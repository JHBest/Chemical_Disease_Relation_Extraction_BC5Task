133615	2	50	Doc_133615_50_64_Disease and other complications of Doc_133615_92_110_Chemical therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of Doc_133615_161_178_Disease factors: summary report of a ten-year study.
133615	3	224	During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating Doc_133615_343_362_Chemical to changes in hematologic parameters.
133615	4	401	Significant increases in certain factors of the Doc_133615_449_466_Disease and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups.
133615	5	579	Severe complications developed in four patients.
133615	6	628	All four had an abnormal Doc_133615_653_670_Disease profile, suggesting "Doc_133615_692_710_Disease" before initiation of therapy.
133615	7	742	Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy.
133615	8	885	One of these patients developed a Doc_133615_919_940_Disease before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained.
133615	9	1024	One patient developed Doc_133615_1046_1057_Disease 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed Doc_133615_1115_1131_Disease after 27 months of therapy.
133615	10	1160	The fourth patient developed Doc_133615_1189_1205_Disease 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy.
133615	11	1257	All four patients were of the A or AB blood group.
133615	12	1308	Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for Doc_133615_1380_1403_Disease in patients possessing the A antigen.
133615	13	1442	It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term Doc_133615_1551_1569_Chemical therapy.
