10027919	1	121	Doc_10027919_133_143_Chemical therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with Doc_10027919_222_235_Disease but has several drawbacks, including Doc_10027919_273_286_Disease and/or marked Doc_10027919_301_329_Disease, which may lead to Doc_10027919_349_370_Disease.
10027919	2	372	A new Doc_10027919_378_387_Chemical analogue, Doc_10027919_398_414_Chemical (Doc_10027919_416_419_Chemical), has been shown to have promising characteristics.
10027919	3	472	This study was undertaken to determine the effects of Doc_10027919_526_529_Chemical on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or Doc_10027919_591_614_Disease.
10027919	4	616	Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22).
10027919	5	709	The animals received supplemental Doc_10027919_743_752_Chemical to enhance PTH secretion.
10027919	6	779	Fourteen weeks after the start of Doc_10027919_813_822_Chemical supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of Doc_10027919_887_890_Chemical (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks.
10027919	7	963	Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months.
10027919	8	1074	Biochemical and hormonal indices of Doc_10027919_1110_1117_Chemical and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after Doc_10027919_1230_1233_Chemical or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period.
10027919	9	1296	In Nx dogs, Doc_10027919_1317_1320_Chemical significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of Doc_10027919_1390_1409_Disease.
10027919	10	1411	In long-standing Doc_10027919_1428_1457_Disease, Doc_10027919_1459_1462_Chemical (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months.
10027919	11	1533	Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control.
10027919	12	1657	These effects were accompanied by episodes of Doc_10027919_1703_1716_Disease and Doc_10027919_1721_1738_Disease.
10027919	13	1740	In animals with normal renal function, Doc_10027919_1779_1782_Chemical induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses.
10027919	14	1912	In Nx dogs, Doc_10027919_1924_1927_Chemical reversed abnormal bone formation, such as Doc_10027919_1970_1983_Disease and Doc_10027919_1988_1996_Disease, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover.
10027919	15	2058	In addition, Doc_10027919_2071_2074_Chemical improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs.
10027919	16	2184	These results indicate that even though Doc_10027919_2237_2240_Chemical does not completely prevent the occurrence of Doc_10027919_2287_2300_Disease in experimental dogs with Doc_10027919_2327_2346_Disease, it may be of use in the management of Doc_10027919_2386_2415_Disease because it does not induce Doc_10027919_2443_2460_Disease and, therefore, does not increase the risk of Doc_10027919_2507_2528_Disease.
10074612	0	0	Doc_10074612_0_11_Disease, Doc_10074612_13_24_Disease, and Doc_10074612_30_38_Disease after high-dose intravenous Doc_10074612_67_85_Chemical in a monitored patient.
10074612	1	110	We report a case of Doc_10074612_130_141_Disease, Doc_10074612_143_154_Disease, and Doc_10074612_160_168_Disease after intravenous administration of high-dose Doc_10074612_215_233_Chemical in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode.
10074612	2	335	There was a history of Doc_10074612_358_366_Disease Doc_10074612_367_382_Disease 9 years earlier.
10074612	3	400	The patient was admitted with a Doc_10074612_432_456_Disease with Doc_10074612_462_472_Disease, rapidly progressive Doc_10074612_494_507_Disease, and Doc_10074612_513_522_Disease that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.
10074612	4	588	After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm.
10074612	5	682	The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without Doc_10074612_725_747_Disease.
10074612	6	749	This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of Doc_10074612_803_815_Disease after a high dose of intravenous Doc_10074612_849_867_Chemical (Doc_10074612_869_873_Chemical).
10074612	7	876	These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event.
10074612	8	1001	Rapid infusion and underlying Doc_10074612_1031_1046_Disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount Doc_10074612_1127_1149_Disease as the main mechanism.
10091616	0	0	Worsening of Doc_10091616_13_21_Chemical-induced Doc_10091616_30_41_Disease by motor and mental tasks.
10091616	1	69	Ten patients who had Doc_10091616_90_109_Disease with disabling Doc_10091616_125_135_Disease were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose Doc_10091616_381_391_Disease following administration of an effective single dose of Doc_10091616_448_459_Chemical.
10091616	2	461	Compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the Doc_10091616_539_549_Disease score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05).
10091616	3	776	These results suggest that activation tasks such as "speaking aloud" could be used for objective assessment of Doc_10091616_887_897_Disease severity.
10193809	0	0	Urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase--a marker of tubular damage?
10193809	1	67	Although an indicator of Doc_10193809_104_129_Disease, an increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells.
10193809	2	266	Doc_10193809_275_300_Chemical (Doc_10193809_302_305_Chemical) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce Doc_10193809_357_368_Disease.
10193809	3	370	Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days.
10193809	4	493	The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three.
10193809	5	674	Following intravenous Doc_10193809_705_708_Chemical urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four.
10193809	6	817	After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity.
10193809	7	936	Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards.
10193809	8	1056	Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four.
10193809	9	1128	Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak Doc_10193809_1219_1230_Disease and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards).
10193809	10	1310	This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells.
10193809	11	1488	Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.

10225068	1	185	Six cases of Doc_10225068_198_219_Disease with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997.
10225068	2	325	All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% Doc_10225068_389_399_Chemical.
10225068	3	401	Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block.
10225068	4	512	The dose of hyperbaric 5% Doc_10225068_538_548_Chemical administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.
10225068	5	588	Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct Doc_10225068_641_654_Disease of hyperbaric 5% Doc_10225068_672_682_Chemical.
10225068	6	684	In the other 3 cases, direct Doc_10225068_713_726_Disease was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology.
10225068	7	853	All cases sustained permanent Doc_10225068_883_904_Disease.
10225068	8	906	We recommend that hyperbaric Doc_10225068_935_945_Chemical should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.

10328196	1	171	Doc_10328196_183_192_Chemical (formerly Doc_10328196_203_212_Chemical) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation.
10328196	2	284	After 2 individuals with Doc_10328196_309_318_Disease developed a Doc_10328196_331_354_Disease following treatment with oral Doc_10328196_385_394_Chemical lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis.
10328196	3	494	A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with Doc_10328196_553_562_Chemical-induced Doc_10328196_571_594_Disease had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected Doc_10328196_689_698_Chemical-treated patient with Doc_10328196_720_729_Disease (21%).
10328196	4	737	Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with Doc_10328196_791_800_Disease tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or Doc_10328196_842_855_Chemical-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of Doc_10328196_931_940_Chemical.
10328196	5	942	Severe adverse effects of Doc_10328196_981_990_Chemical include Doc_10328196_999_1004_Disease, Doc_10328196_1006_1012_Disease, and Doc_10328196_1018_1041_Disease.
10328196	6	1043	These symptoms may be the result of drug-induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators.
10328196	7	1210	Because patients with severe Doc_10328196_1239_1248_Disease may develop Doc_10328196_1261_1275_Disease from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with Doc_10328196_1360_1381_Disease who are treated with immune modulators.

10354657	6	647	The control group consisted of 82 patients with no Doc_10354657_698_709_Disease or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics.
10354657	7	781	OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of Doc_10354657_822_829_Chemical, Doc_10354657_831_840_Chemical and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning Doc_10354657_907_914_Chemical therapy and at biannual follow-up.
10354657	8	950	Doc_10354657_959_973_Disease developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were Doc_10354657_1030_1041_Disease at baseline.
10354657	9	1055	All patients having first-degree relatives affected by Doc_10354657_1110_1125_Disease had accelerated onset of Doc_10354657_1151_1165_Disease (3.7 years after onset of Doc_10354657_1192_1199_Chemical therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of Doc_10354657_1283_1290_Chemical therapy).
10354657	10	1301	Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by Doc_10354657_1356_1370_Disease than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%).
10354657	11	1426	Doc_10354657_1426_1435_Chemical levels in patients on Doc_10354657_1458_1465_Chemical treatment were unchanged from baseline levels.

10414674	3	313	Patients with Doc_10414674_327_361_Disease (Doc_10414674_363_366_Disease) were randomized to receive either Doc_10414674_402_412_Chemical, 100 mg, three times a day (Doc_10414674_441_451_Chemical group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, Doc_10414674_483_496_Chemical, 1 g, three times a day (Doc_10414674_522_535_Chemical group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of Doc_10414674_594_604_Disease Doc_10414674_605_608_Disease.
10414674	4	610	Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively.
10414674	5	662	Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings.
10414674	6	787	Maximal Doc_10414674_795_815_Disease induced by 6 microM of Doc_10414674_839_860_Chemical decreased after administration of Doc_10414674_895_905_Chemical.
10414674	7	907	Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the Doc_10414674_946_956_Chemical group than in the Doc_10414674_975_988_Chemical group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day.
10414674	8	1051	In contrast, maximal Doc_10414674_1072_1092_Disease increased in the Doc_10414674_1110_1123_Chemical group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment Doc_10414674_1195_1215_Disease results (P < .05).

10523326	1	77	We recently showed elevated reactive Doc_10523326_114_120_Chemical species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of Doc_10523326_165_167_Chemical metabolites (NOx), and increased Doc_10523326_201_203_Chemical sequestration as Doc_10523326_221_234_Chemical in various tissues in rats with Doc_10523326_267_271_Chemical-induced Doc_10523326_280_292_Disease.
10523326	2	294	This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in Doc_10523326_369_373_Chemical-induced Doc_10523326_382_394_Disease is, in part, due to depressed Doc_10523326_425_427_Chemical synthase (NOS) expression.
10523326	3	455	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a Doc_10523326_508_512_Chemical-treated group (given Doc_10523326_534_546_Chemical, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given Doc_10523326_612_616_Chemical and Doc_10523326_621_630_Chemical-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or Doc_10523326_712_721_Chemical-fortified food for 12 weeks.
10523326	4	751	Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma Doc_10523326_802_817_Chemical (Doc_10523326_819_822_Chemical), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured.
10523326	5	923	The Doc_10523326_927_931_Chemical-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma Doc_10523326_992_995_Chemical concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.
10523326	6	1122	Doc_10523326_1122_1131_Chemical supplementation ameliorated Doc_10523326_1160_1172_Disease, lowered plasma Doc_10523326_1189_1192_Chemical concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.

10524660	2	273	In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule Doc_10524660_352_364_Chemical (Doc_10524660_366_368_Chemical) is involved in Doc_10524660_385_389_Disease mechanisms of Doc_10524660_404_425_Disease.
10524660	3	427	In order to clarify whether the same is true for Doc_10524660_476_494_Disease, in the present study we examined the Doc_10524660_533_541_Disease response to intravenous infusion of Doc_10524660_578_597_Chemical (Doc_10524660_599_602_Chemical) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of Doc_10524660_654_672_Disease.
10524660	4	674	The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of Doc_10524660_744_765_Disease could be induced.
10524660	5	784	Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls.
10524660	6	830	Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject.
10524660	7	878	Doc_10524660_878_886_Disease was more severe in Doc_10524660_906_917_Disease than in the controls during and immediately after Doc_10524660_968_971_Chemical infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008).
10524660	8	1041	In the controls, the Doc_10524660_1062_1065_Chemical-induced Doc_10524660_1074_1082_Disease gradually disappeared, whereas in Doc_10524660_1117_1128_Disease peak Doc_10524660_1134_1142_Disease intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion.

10840460	3	370	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doc_10840460_393_395_Chemical was administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg./kg. i.p. to male rats, and their behavior observed and scored.
10840460	4	508	The effects of Doc_10840460_523_531_Chemical (0.5 to 4 mg./kg. i.v.) on Doc_10840460_559_561_Chemical-induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after Doc_10840460_636_644_Chemical (1 mg./kg. s.c.).

10840460	11	1647	In female rats, Doc_10840460_1663_1665_Chemical 200 mg./kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats.
10840460	12	1765	Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, Doc_10840460_1816_1818_Chemical did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas Doc_10840460_1867_1875_Chemical at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under Doc_10840460_1960_1962_Chemical 200 mg./kg. i.p., with the same maximal levels.
10840460	13	2011	Conversely, Doc_10840460_2023_2031_Chemical 5 mg./kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all.
10840460	14	2094	Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of Doc_10840460_2171_2173_Chemical-induced Doc_10840460_2182_2190_Disease may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory Doc_10840460_2250_2263_Disease, allowing a better understanding of these Doc_10840460_2306_2323_Disease and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.

10910842	1	117	Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood.
10910842	2	265	We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of Doc_10910842_324_336_Chemical on muscle function and pharmacology, and their relationship to changes in muscle size and Doc_10910842_427_440_Chemical receptor (AChR) expression.
10910842	3	469	With institutional approval, 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg/kg Doc_10910842_593_605_Chemical (P10 group), 100 mg/kg Doc_10910842_629_641_Chemical (P100 group), or an equal volume of saline (S group) for 7 days.
10910842	4	707	A fourth group of rats was pair fed (food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days (FR group).
10910842	5	803	On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, Doc_10910842_852_859_Disease tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of Doc_10910842_920_934_Chemical in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs.
10910842	6	1041	Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group.
10910842	7	1139	Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups.
10910842	8	1219	The evoked peak twitch and Doc_10910842_1246_1253_Disease tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group.
10910842	9	1417	The 50% effective dose of Doc_10910842_1443_1457_Chemical (microg/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +/- 9.6) groups.
10910842	10	1595	AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group.
10910842	11	1658	The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR.
10910842	12	1770	The 50% effective dose of Doc_10910842_1796_1810_Chemical did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression.
10910842	13	1866	Our results suggest that the Doc_10910842_1895_1920_Disease after Doc_10910842_1927_1939_Chemical is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from Doc_10910842_1986_2000_Disease and derives less so from changes in AChR expression.
10910842	14	2054	The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear.
10910842	15	2185	We suggest that the observed effects are dose-dependent and derive primarily from Doc_10910842_2267_2281_Disease and derive less from changes in Doc_10910842_2314_2327_Chemical receptor expression.
11009181	0	0	Doc_11009181_0_11_Chemical: an underutilized therapy for Doc_11009181_42_61_Disease.
11009181	1	63	Doc_11009181_63_74_Chemical was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Doc_11009181_138_157_Disease.
11009181	2	159	While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Doc_11009181_273_292_Disease by subcutaneous administration of Doc_11009181_327_338_Chemical has only recently become the subject of systematic study.
11009181	3	397	A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous Doc_11009181_493_504_Chemical injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with Doc_11009181_590_598_Chemical and that Doc_11009181_608_619_Chemical rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings.
11009181	4	721	Continuous subcutaneous Doc_11009181_745_756_Chemical infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral Doc_11009181_930_938_Chemical agonists or COMT inhibitors.
11009181	5	968	Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of Doc_11009181_1055_1066_Chemical efficacy.
11009181	6	1077	In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous Doc_11009181_1174_1185_Chemical infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting Doc_11009181_1248_1256_Chemical-induced Doc_11009181_1265_1276_Disease.
11009181	7	1278	The main side effects of subcutaneous Doc_11009181_1316_1327_Chemical treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and Doc_11009181_1407_1418_Disease complications play a lesser role.
11009181	8	1453	Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous Doc_11009181_1505_1516_Chemical treatment in fluctuating Doc_11009181_1542_1561_Disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.
11022397	0	0	Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.
11022397	1	61	The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Doc_11022397_250_269_Disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied.
11022397	2	361	This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the Doc_11022397_419_430_Chemical-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with Doc_11022397_508_519_Chemical.
11022397	3	521	Doc_11022397_521_532_Chemical was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly.
11022397	4	647	Randomized double-blind controlled trial.
11022397	5	697	Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers.
11022397	6	783	Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours.
11022397	7	884	The study involved 4 sessions.
11022397	8	915	In 1 session, Doc_11022397_929_940_Chemical (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other.
11022397	9	1014	In another session, Doc_11022397_1034_1045_Chemical (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of Doc_11022397_1144_1155_Chemical (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other.
11022397	10	1211	All eye drops were given in a randomized order.
11022397	11	1259	In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of Doc_11022397_1300_1311_Chemical (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours.
11022397	12	1467	OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of Doc_11022397_1535_1546_Chemical and Doc_11022397_1551_1562_Chemical; Doc_11022397_1564_1575_Chemical-induced Doc_11022397_1584_1609_Disease.
11022397	13	1611	There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to Doc_11022397_1718_1729_Chemical at any time point (p > 0.05).
11022397	14	1760	The elderly group had a significantly greater Doc_11022397_1806_1817_Chemical-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05).
11022397	15	1946	Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater Doc_11022397_2007_2018_Chemical-induced Doc_11022397_2027_2052_Disease 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05).
11022397	16	2109	There is an age-related pupillary response to Doc_11022397_2167_2178_Chemical that is not found with Doc_11022397_2202_2213_Chemical.
11022397	17	2215	Thus, Doc_11022397_2221_2232_Chemical may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.
11027904	0	0	Doc_11027904_0_4_Disease responses in Doc_11027904_18_27_Chemical-maintained opioid abusers.
11027904	1	55	Providing Doc_11027904_65_69_Disease management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task, in part because little is known about their Doc_11027904_182_186_Disease experience and analgesic requirements.
11027904	2	226	This study was designed to describe Doc_11027904_262_266_Disease tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of Doc_11027904_315_329_Disease stabilized in Doc_11027904_344_353_Chemical-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60).
11027904	3	455	By using a placebo-controlled, two-way factorial design, tolerance to cold-pressor (CP) Doc_11027904_543_547_Disease was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid (Doc_11027904_643_656_Chemical 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (Doc_11027904_699_708_Chemical 10 mg) analgesic agents.
11027904	4	734	Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP Doc_11027904_808_812_Disease than control subjects, replicating previous work.
11027904	5	863	Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group.
11027904	6	932	These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a Doc_11027904_987_1002_Disease subset of clinical patients.
11027904	7	1032	Their complaints of Doc_11027904_1052_1056_Disease should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively.
11058428	0	0	High-dose Doc_11058428_10_28_Chemical may do more harm for Doc_11058428_50_68_Disease.
11058428	1	70	Because of the National Acute Doc_11058428_100_118_Disease Studies (NASCIS), high-dose Doc_11058428_147_165_Chemical became the standard of care for the acute Doc_11058428_208_226_Disease.
11058428	2	228	In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute Doc_11058428_299_313_Chemical Doc_11058428_314_322_Disease that high-dose Doc_11058428_338_356_Chemical may cause.
11058428	3	368	The dosage of Doc_11058428_382_400_Chemical recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of Doc_11058428_452_460_Chemical ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition.
11058428	4	527	We hypothesize that it may cause some Doc_11058428_565_585_Disease of Doc_11058428_589_607_Disease patients.
11058428	5	618	Further, Doc_11058428_627_634_Chemical Doc_11058428_635_643_Disease recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the Doc_11058428_780_787_Chemical Doc_11058428_788_796_Disease, instead of any protection that Doc_11058428_829_847_Chemical offers to the Doc_11058428_862_880_Disease.
11058428	6	882	To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the Doc_11058428_966_984_Chemical recommended by NASCIS may cause acute Doc_11058428_1023_1037_Chemical Doc_11058428_1038_1046_Disease.

11077455	4	521	The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.
11077455	5	619	Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.
11077455	6	846	Seven patients showed marked Doc_11077455_884_909_Disease with some sparing of the temporal visual field.
11077455	7	958	The eighth exhibited concentric constriction.
11077455	8	1004	Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave.
11077455	9	1204	However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials.
11077455	10	1323	Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.

11079278	6	622	Before Doc_11079278_629_639_Chemical was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive Doc_11079278_757_767_Chemical or Doc_11079278_771_781_Chemical plus glucagon 1 mg.
11079278	7	802	Doc_11079278_802_812_Chemical was dosed to achieve a resting Doc_11079278_844_857_Chemical heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg.
11079278	8	929	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Doc_11079278_960_970_Chemical reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control.
11079278	9	1078	Doc_11079278_1078_1088_Chemical plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control.
11079278	10	1159	Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control.
11079278	11	1300	No significant differences were found in any parameter between Doc_11079278_1363_1373_Chemical and Doc_11079278_1378_1388_Chemical-glucagon.
11079278	12	1399	During Doc_11079278_1418_1428_Chemical stress testing, Doc_11079278_1445_1455_Chemical attenuates or eliminates evidence of Doc_11079278_1493_1512_Disease.
11079278	13	1514	Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.
11099450	0	0	Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.
11099450	1	70	The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on Doc_11099450_227_239_Disease 'off' signs and Doc_11099450_256_264_Chemical-induced Doc_11099450_273_284_Disease (Doc_11099450_286_289_Disease).
11099450	2	292	We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative Doc_11099450_360_368_Chemical responsiveness of motor signs and the Doc_11099450_407_415_Chemical responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in Doc_11099450_652_655_Disease.
11099450	3	657	We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in Doc_11099450_802_805_Disease in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in Doc_11099450_917_929_Disease 'off' signs.
11099450	4	943	The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either Doc_11099450_1051_1062_Disease or Doc_11099450_1066_1078_Disease 'off' signs.
11099450	5	1092	The differential predictive value of Doc_11099450_1129_1137_Chemical responsiveness for the outcome of Doc_11099450_1172_1184_Disease 'off' signs and Doc_11099450_1201_1204_Disease and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with Doc_11099450_1266_1277_Disease and Doc_11099450_1282_1294_Disease 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of Doc_11099450_1416_1428_Disease 'off' signs and Doc_11099450_1445_1456_Disease.
11099450	6	1458	Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in Doc_11099450_1520_1532_Disease, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of Doc_11099450_1595_1598_Disease.
11099450	7	1600	We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate Doc_11099450_1726_1738_Disease and Doc_11099450_1743_1754_Disease, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.
11099450	8	1822	The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.

11185967	1	76	The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for Doc_11185967_185_192_Chemical or Doc_11185967_196_207_Chemical in adult emergency department Doc_11185967_238_245_Disease patients.
11185967	2	256	This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible Doc_11185967_319_326_Disease patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation.
11185967	3	408	Plasma was tested for Doc_11185967_430_441_Chemical and the Doc_11185967_450_457_Chemical metabolite Doc_11185967_469_484_Chemical using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology.
11185967	4	532	Plasma samples with Doc_11185967_552_567_Chemical greater than 150 ng/mL or an Doc_11185967_597_608_Chemical greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive.
11185967	5	658	Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or Doc_11185967_710_717_Chemical-related Doc_11185967_726_733_Disease disorder, estimated time from Doc_11185967_764_771_Disease to sample collection, history or suspicion of Doc_11185967_818_846_Disease, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers.
11185967	6	963	Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for Doc_11185967_1069_1084_Chemical and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for Doc_11185967_1138_1149_Chemical.
11185967	7	1151	Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of Doc_11185967_1250_1278_Disease (p < 0.0005).
11185967	8	1293	During this study period, routine plasma screening for Doc_11185967_1361_1368_Chemical and Doc_11185967_1373_1385_Chemical in adult Doc_11185967_1395_1402_Disease patients had a low yield.
11185967	9	1429	As a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of Doc_11185967_1561_1571_Disease in this population.

11195262	4	487	We consider this episode of Doc_11195262_515_520_Disease to be the result of a combination of factors including a Doc_11195262_578_616_Disease and the long-term administration of Doc_11195262_653_656_Chemical.

11208990	2	247	We have studied the role of Doc_11208990_275_277_Chemical and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of Doc_11208990_341_359_Disease induced by a single injection of Doc_11208990_393_403_Chemical (Doc_11208990_405_408_Chemical).
11208990	3	411	The alteration in the Doc_11208990_442_444_Chemical pathway was assessed by measuring Doc_11208990_479_486_Chemical levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system.
11208990	4	613	Rats were stratified into control groups and Doc_11208990_658_661_Chemical-induced Doc_11208990_670_681_Disease groups.
11208990	5	690	These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving Doc_11208990_797_811_Chemical (Doc_11208990_813_815_Chemical) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-Doc_11208990_860_862_Chemical synthase.
11208990	6	873	On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis.
11208990	7	956	Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with Doc_11208990_1031_1034_Chemical revealed focal areas of Doc_11208990_1059_1082_Disease and mild Doc_11208990_1092_1123_Disease.
11208990	8	1125	They also had significantly higher levels of Doc_11208990_1170_1181_Disease compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05).
11208990	9	1237	Urine Doc_11208990_1243_1250_Chemical levels were significantly increased in the Doc_11208990_1294_1297_Chemical-Doc_11208990_1298_1309_Disease group (P < 0.05).
11208990	10	1328	In the IPRK Doc_11208990_1340_1353_Chemical and Doc_11208990_1358_1371_Chemical related responses were significantly impaired in the Doc_11208990_1425_1428_Chemical-Doc_11208990_1429_1440_Disease group.
11208990	11	1448	Apoptosis was not detected in controls.
11208990	12	1488	However, in the Doc_11208990_1504_1507_Chemical-Doc_11208990_1508_1519_Disease group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas.
11208990	13	1601	Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages.
11208990	14	1718	Treatment with Doc_11208990_1733_1735_Chemical prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine Doc_11208990_1816_1823_Chemical levels and apoptosis to control levels.
11208990	15	1864	We suggest that interactions between Doc_11208990_1913_1915_Chemical and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the Doc_11208990_1971_1974_Chemical-induced Doc_11208990_1983_1992_Disease.

11226639	3	310	Doc_11226639_310_319_Chemical pre-treatment affected in a dual manner Doc_11226639_360_371_Chemical Doc_11226639_372_380_Disease, however, no dose-effect correlation was found.
11226639	4	429	In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of Doc_11226639_507_518_Chemical Doc_11226639_519_527_Disease.
11226639	5	529	In contrast, the highest dose of Doc_11226639_562_571_Chemical (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of Doc_11226639_682_690_Disease, and a reduction in mortality rate.
11226639	6	727	Doc_11226639_727_736_Chemical 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of Doc_11226639_800_808_Chemical- or Doc_11226639_813_821_Chemical-induced Doc_11226639_830_838_Disease.

11243580	2	254	In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), Doc_11243580_337_347_Chemical (300 mg/kg, i.p.), Doc_11243580_367_373_Chemical (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and Doc_11243580_396_404_Chemical (2 mg/kg), respectively.
11243580	3	430	Thirty minutes after these injections, all mice received Doc_11243580_487_496_Chemical (50 mg/kg, i.p.).
11243580	4	515	In the second experiment, four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment, and 30 min after these injections, all mice received a higher dose of Doc_11243580_683_692_Chemical (80 mg/kg).

11705128	1	130	Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/Doc_11705128_281_290_Chemical compared with Doc_11705128_305_321_Chemical monotherapy in the treatment of Doc_11705128_354_373_Disease (Doc_11705128_375_378_Disease).
11705128	2	381	Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: Doc_11705128_459_468_Chemical-induced Doc_11705128_477_493_Disease (Doc_11705128_495_499_Disease).
11705128	3	502	The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of Doc_11705128_593_597_Disease during treatment of Doc_11705128_618_621_Disease in a clinical trial setting.
11705128	4	651	A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of Doc_11705128_766_770_Disease.
11705128	5	772	Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating Doc_11705128_844_848_Disease.
11705128	6	850	Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses.
11705128	7	904	Doc_11705128_913_917_Disease, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy.
11705128	8	1057	The standard of care for management of Doc_11705128_1096_1100_Disease is reduction or discontinuation of the Doc_11705128_1140_1149_Chemical dosage.
11705128	9	1158	We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant Doc_11705128_1222_1226_Disease to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692).
11705128	10	1327	The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317.
11705128	11	1400	In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459.
11705128	12	1471	The direct cost of treating clinically significant Doc_11705128_1535_1539_Disease is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs.
11705128	13	1586	Questions remain about the optimal dose of Doc_11705128_1629_1638_Chemical and the incidence of Doc_11705128_1660_1664_Disease in a real-world population.
11705128	14	1693	Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating Doc_11705128_1777_1781_Disease provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.

11752998	2	434	The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of Doc_11752998_517_526_Chemical marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and Doc_11752998_588_597_Chemical-evoked mechanical Doc_11752998_616_632_Disease.
11752998	3	634	Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal Doc_11752998_848_857_Chemical doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Doc_11752998_927_936_Chemical, 2 mg.

11752998	5	1164	Doc_11752998_1173_1182_Chemical produced no effect on Doc_11752998_1205_1209_Disease report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced Doc_11752998_1278_1301_Disease and Doc_11752998_1306_1315_Disease from intradermal Doc_11752998_1333_1342_Chemical injection for at least 24 h.
11752998	6	1372	In contrast, residence time of Doc_11752998_1403_1412_Chemical in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h).
11752998	7	1455	These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal Doc_11752998_1523_1532_Chemical of Doc_11752998_1536_1552_Disease, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral Doc_11752998_1623_1632_Chemical injection.
11752998	8	1644	The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic Doc_11752998_1749_1765_Disease and is not due to prolonged residence of Doc_11752998_1807_1816_Chemical in cerebrospinal fluid.

11860278	1	107	Doc_11860278_107_115_Chemical (Doc_11860278_117_119_Chemical), through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of Doc_11860278_202_220_Disease arising in the limbic system.
11860278	2	251	Doc_11860278_251_265_Disease leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of Doc_11860278_345_353_Disease at the cellular level.
11860278	3	377	In this respect, little is known about the role of Doc_11860278_428_430_Chemical receptors in the occurrence of Doc_11860278_462_470_Disease-induced neuronal cell death.
11860278	4	500	Here we analyze the occurrence of Doc_11860278_534_542_Disease and Doc_11860278_547_560_Disease in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist Doc_11860278_614_625_Chemical.
11860278	5	627	We compared these results with those previously obtained with Doc_11860278_689_700_Chemical (Doc_11860278_702_704_Chemical), a potent Doc_11860278_716_725_Chemical agonist.
11860278	6	735	Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop Doc_11860278_769_777_Disease at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater Doc_11860278_864_877_Disease.
11860278	7	879	However, Doc_11860278_888_899_Chemical-induced Doc_11860278_908_916_Disease result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to Doc_11860278_1007_1009_Chemical.
11860278	8	1011	Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for Doc_11860278_1061_1069_Disease induced by both Doc_11860278_1086_1095_Chemical and Doc_11860278_1100_1113_Chemical.
11860278	9	1115	Moreover, the dopaminergic control of Doc_11860278_1153_1161_Disease-induced Doc_11860278_1170_1187_Disease seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.
11860495	0	0	Doc_11860495_0_7_Chemical structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-Doc_11860495_68_75_Disease effects of Doc_11860495_87_108_Chemical in the passive avoidance task in rats.
11860495	1	148	Doc_11860495_148_169_Chemical (Doc_11860495_171_176_Chemical) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory-enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process.
11860495	2	351	The mechanism by which this endogenous Doc_11860495_390_397_Chemical enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems.
11860495	3	499	This hypothesis stems from findings that Doc_11860495_540_545_Chemical is a potent positive modulator of Doc_11860495_580_600_Chemical receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of Doc_11860495_648_671_Chemical(A) receptors (Doc_11860495_686_690_Chemical(A)Rs).
11860495	4	698	Moreover, Doc_11860495_708_713_Chemical is able to reverse the Doc_11860495_737_744_Disease-like effects of NMDAR and Doc_11860495_771_775_Chemical(A)R ligands.
11860495	5	789	To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of Doc_11860495_911_916_Chemical, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and/or Doc_11860495_967_971_Chemical(A)R function.
11860495	6	986	The analogs tested were: Doc_11860495_1011_1039_Chemical (an agent that is inactive at Doc_11860495_1070_1074_Chemical(A)Rs and NMDARs), Doc_11860495_1093_1155_Chemical, an inhibitor of both Doc_11860495_1178_1182_Chemical(A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) Doc_11860495_1229_1234_Chemical enantiomer (which is identical to Doc_11860495_1269_1274_Chemical in effects on Doc_11860495_1289_1293_Chemical(A)Rs and NMDARs).
11860495	7	1312	The memory-enhancing effects of Doc_11860495_1344_1349_Chemical and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of Doc_11860495_1427_1438_Chemical-induced Doc_11860495_1447_1454_Disease.
11860495	8	1456	Both Doc_11860495_1461_1466_Chemical and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of Doc_11860495_1513_1524_Chemical.
11860495	9	1526	The results show that, unlike Doc_11860495_1556_1561_Chemical, Doc_11860495_1563_1591_Chemical and Doc_11860495_1596_1620_Chemical failed to block the effect of Doc_11860495_1651_1662_Chemical, suggesting that altering the modulation of Doc_11860495_1707_1711_Chemical receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of Doc_11860495_1765_1770_Chemical.
11860495	10	1772	Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural Doc_11860495_1844_1849_Chemical to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing Doc_11860495_1936_1947_Chemical-induced Doc_11860495_1956_1963_Disease.
11860495	11	1965	These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive Doc_11860495_2076_2084_Chemical.

11861791	1	107	Activation of the nuclear enzyme Doc_11861791_140_156_Chemical polymerase (PARP) by oxidant-mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress.
11861791	2	316	Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the Doc_11861791_379_393_Disease of Doc_11861791_397_408_Chemical (Doc_11861791_410_413_Chemical), a widely used antitumor Doc_11861791_440_453_Chemical antibiotic.
11861791	3	466	Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the Doc_11861791_538_541_Chemical-induced Doc_11861791_550_564_Disease.
11861791	4	566	Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor Doc_11861791_702_706_Chemical, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of Doc_11861791_766_785_Disease induced by Doc_11861791_797_800_Chemical.
11861791	5	802	PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- mice received a single injection of Doc_11861791_862_865_Chemical (25 mg/kg i.p).
11861791	6	882	Five days after Doc_11861791_898_901_Chemical administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-/- ones.
11861791	7	1042	Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with Doc_11861791_1105_1109_Chemical or vehicle.
11861791	8	1122	Treatment with a Doc_11861791_1139_1143_Chemical significantly improved Doc_11861791_1167_1186_Disease and increased the survival of the animals.
11861791	9	1230	In addition Doc_11861791_1242_1246_Chemical significantly reduced the Doc_11861791_1273_1276_Chemical-induced increase in the serum Doc_11861791_1307_1314_Chemical dehydrogenase and Doc_11861791_1333_1341_Chemical kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart.
11861791	10	1411	Thus, PARP activation contributes to the Doc_11861791_1452_1466_Disease of Doc_11861791_1470_1473_Chemical.
11861791	11	1475	PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe Doc_11861791_1554_1575_Disease associated with the Doc_11861791_1596_1599_Chemical treatment.

11868798	6	867	Patients receiving concomitant Doc_11868798_907_910_Chemical and Doc_11868798_915_929_Chemical had significantly higher plasma Doc_11868798_962_971_Chemical levels than those receiving Doc_11868798_1000_1003_Chemical alone (P = 0.0027).
11868798	7	1024	Those patients receiving Doc_11868798_1049_1052_Chemical and Doc_11868798_1057_1071_Chemical required significantly less Doc_11868798_1100_1109_Chemical supplementation to maintain their plasma Doc_11868798_1151_1160_Chemical within the normal range (P = 0.022).

11999899	9	1229	Doc_11999899_1229_1235_Chemical (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the Doc_11999899_1278_1287_Disease and Doc_11999899_1292_1298_Disease induced by Doc_11999899_1310_1319_Chemical.
11999899	10	1321	Pretreatment with Doc_11999899_1339_1348_Chemical (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in Doc_11999899_1487_1493_Disease and Doc_11999899_1498_1507_Disease, whereas Doc_11999899_1517_1523_Chemical (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of Doc_11999899_1593_1602_Chemical.
11999899	11	1604	These results show that Doc_11999899_1628_1637_Chemical produces different and Doc_11999899_1661_1679_Disease, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as Doc_11999899_1754_1766_Disease-like and Doc_11999899_1776_1794_Disease signs.
11999899	12	1802	The glutamatergic blockage produced by Doc_11999899_1841_1845_Chemical can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, Doc_11999899_1926_1935_Disease and Doc_11999899_1940_1946_Disease according to the employed model.

12013711	1	121	Two Doc_12013711_125_138_Disease patients, who had a prior history of Doc_12013711_176_179_Chemical abuse and who had previously developed Doc_12013711_219_222_Disease with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with Doc_12013711_283_294_Chemical.
12013711	2	296	They both reported short episodes of transient Doc_12013711_343_362_Disease, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with Doc_12013711_421_432_Chemical.
12013711	3	434	This imagery resembled Doc_12013711_457_476_Disease previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior Doc_12013711_533_536_Chemical consumption.
12013711	4	550	Doc_12013711_550_561_Chemical administration was continued and the Doc_12013711_599_618_Disease gradually wore off.
12013711	5	639	During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of Doc_12013711_703_722_Disease.
12013711	6	724	This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of Doc_12013711_854_865_Chemical or interfere with treatment.
12013711	7	895	Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.

12042105	1	36	Doc_12042105_36_46_Chemical is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating Doc_12042105_172_191_Disease.
12042105	2	193	Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause Doc_12042105_251_269_Disease in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.
12042105	3	329	In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH. These factors can lead to the development of Doc_12042105_494_511_Chemical Doc_12042105_512_527_Disease.
12042105	4	529	We report the first two cases of Doc_12042105_562_572_Chemical-induced Doc_12042105_581_596_Disease in the urologic literature.
12091028	0	0	Doc_12091028_0_8_Chemical in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture).
12091028	1	75	A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with Doc_12091028_130_138_Chemical was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates.
12091028	2	389	Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/Doc_12091028_570_576_Chemical only.
12091028	3	583	After premedication with Doc_12091028_608_616_Chemical, Doc_12091028_618_632_Chemical and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of Doc_12091028_693_701_Chemical, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of Doc_12091028_748_756_Chemical proved safe and effective.
12091028	4	784	Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate.
12091028	5	871	Doc_12091028_871_879_Chemical, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to Doc_12091028_963_971_Chemical as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative Doc_12091028_1086_1100_Disease.
12091028	6	1102	Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative Doc_12091028_1187_1196_Disease.
12091028	7	1198	An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, Doc_12091028_1271_1285_Chemical being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate.
12091028	8	1391	Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.

Intravenous Doc_12093990_1136_1145_Chemical is the treatment of choice for Doc_12093990_1177_1217_Disease.
12093990	8	1219	The most common adverse effect of intravenous Doc_12093990_1265_1274_Chemical is reversible mild Doc_12093990_1294_1300_Disease.
12093990	9	1302	The use of Doc_12093990_1313_1322_Chemical in severe Doc_12093990_1333_1353_Disease has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is Doc_12093990_1424_1438_Disease.
12093990	10	1440	We report our experience with intravenous Doc_12093990_1493_1502_Chemical therapy for severe Doc_12093990_1522_1540_Disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature.
12093990	11	1610	DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous Doc_12093990_1713_1722_Chemical for documented severe Doc_12093990_1745_1763_Disease.
12093990	12	1765	Two patients developed adenovirus Doc_12093990_1799_1819_Disease after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively.
12093990	13	1877	The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous Doc_12093990_1938_1947_Chemical for progressive disseminated disease.
12093990	14	1986	An additional 3 children developed Doc_12093990_2021_2041_Disease; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial Doc_12093990_2082_2099_Disease.
12093990	15	2101	The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant.
12093990	16	2167	Intravenous Doc_12093990_2179_2188_Chemical was administered on a compassionate-use protocol.
12093990	17	2239	Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus Doc_12093990_2386_2406_Disease and the immunocompetent neonate with Doc_12093990_2444_2464_Disease.
12093990	18	2466	The remaining 3 children died of Doc_12093990_2499_2517_Disease.
12093990	19	2519	Intravenous Doc_12093990_2531_2540_Chemical therapy was well tolerated.
12093990	20	2569	Use of Doc_12093990_2576_2585_Chemical in 1 child was associated with Doc_12093990_2617_2642_Disease and Doc_12093990_2647_2658_Disease.
12093990	21	2660	Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe Doc_12093990_2787_2805_Disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with Doc_12093990_2893_2909_Disease.
12093990	22	2911	Although intravenous Doc_12093990_2932_2941_Chemical was not effective for all children with severe Doc_12093990_2989_3007_Disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the Doc_12093990_3117_3126_Disease.
12093990	23	3128	Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated Doc_12093990_3224_3242_Disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response.
12093990	24	3329	Two of 5 children with severe Doc_12093990_3372_3390_Disease treated with intravenous Doc_12093990_3416_3425_Chemical recovered.
12093990	25	3437	The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of Doc_12093990_3573_3593_Disease possible.
12093990	26	3604	Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of Doc_12093990_3655_3673_Disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous Doc_12093990_3818_3827_Chemical, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

12101159	1	109	A 51 year old man took a mixed Doc_12101159_140_148_Disease including 1.8-3.6 g of Doc_12101159_172_181_Chemical, Doc_12101159_183_194_Chemical, Doc_12101159_196_203_Chemical, Doc_12101159_205_215_Chemical Doc_12101159_216_223_Chemical, and Doc_12101159_229_236_Chemical.
12101159	2	238	He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild Doc_12101159_299_310_Disease and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids.
12101159	3	375	Eighteen hours after the Doc_12101159_400_408_Disease he had two generalised Doc_12101159_432_453_Disease.
12101159	4	455	The patient remained unresponsive with junctional Doc_12101159_505_516_Disease, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became Doc_12101159_563_572_Disease.
12101159	5	574	He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous Doc_12101159_630_637_Chemical and Doc_12101159_642_652_Chemical (Doc_12101159_654_665_Chemical).
12101159	6	668	He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours.
12101159	7	743	This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous Doc_12101159_815_822_Chemical therapy in severe Doc_12101159_841_850_Chemical Doc_12101159_851_859_Disease, particularly with the onset of Doc_12101159_892_900_Disease.
12101159	8	902	It should be considered early in cases of Doc_12101159_944_958_Disease after Doc_12101159_965_974_Chemical Doc_12101159_975_983_Disease.

12109865	1	89	The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy.
12109865	2	303	Doc_12109865_303_325_Chemical (Doc_12109865_327_329_Chemical) is currently the substitute for selected patients.
12109865	3	382	Doc_12109865_382_410_Chemical (Doc_12109865_412_416_Chemical) offers theoretical advantages over Doc_12109865_453_455_Chemical, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to Doc_12109865_533_535_Chemical in patients with prosthetic valves.
12109865	4	572	The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of Doc_12109865_669_673_Chemical in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice.
12109865	5	754	For this paper, the current medical literature on Doc_12109865_813_817_Chemical in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed.
12109865	6	885	There were eight series and six case reports.
12109865	7	940	None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective.
12109865	8	1006	Data to establish the Doc_12109865_1028_1042_Disease risk were incomplete.
12109865	9	1065	After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10).
12109865	10	1356	The incidence rate of Doc_12109865_1378_1393_Disease was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for Doc_12109865_1490_1500_Disease, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups).
12109865	11	1578	In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term Doc_12109865_1644_1648_Chemical therapy compares favorably with Doc_12109865_1681_1683_Chemical.
12109865	12	1685	Data on mid- and long-term Doc_12109865_1712_1716_Chemical administration in these patients are sparse.
12109865	13	1762	Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of Doc_12109865_1861_1865_Chemical in patients with mechanical heart valves.

12139551	1	144	We describe a patient where intravenous injection of Doc_12139551_197_211_Chemical was immediately followed by Doc_12139551_240_248_Disease repeatedly.
12139551	2	261	The patient received Doc_12139551_282_296_Chemical 10 mg i.v. five times during 48 h.
12139551	3	332	After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of Doc_12139551_454_468_Chemical was immediately (within s) followed by Doc_12139551_508_516_Disease.
12139551	4	518	The Doc_12139551_522_530_Disease lasted 15-30 s on four occasions, on one occasion it lasted 2 min.
12139551	5	598	The patient received Doc_12139551_619_627_Chemical 0.5-1 mg and chest compressions, before sinus rhythm again took over.
12139551	6	698	We interpret this as episodes of Doc_12139551_731_745_Disease caused by Doc_12139551_756_770_Chemical.
12139551	7	772	The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of Doc_12139551_853_861_Chemical infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction.
12180796	0	0	Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of Doc_12180796_47_59_Chemical (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and Doc_12180796_110_115_Disease growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in Doc_12180796_151_160_Disease induced in rats by Doc_12180796_180_190_Chemical and Doc_12180796_195_207_Chemical, vasodilators.
12180796	1	223	Doc_12180796_223_232_Disease induced in rats by vasodilators, Doc_12180796_266_276_Chemical and Doc_12180796_281_293_Chemical, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of Doc_12180796_367_379_Chemical synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and Doc_12180796_439_444_Disease growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1).
12180796	2	478	Rats were administered Doc_12180796_501_511_Chemical for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of Doc_12180796_614_626_Chemical.
12180796	3	628	Irrespective of Doc_12180796_644_656_Chemical administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-Doc_12180796_755_765_Chemical-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI.
12180796	4	936	These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat Doc_12180796_1108_1117_Disease models.
12180796	5	1126	On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.
12231232	0	0	The striatum as a target for anti-rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1, but not an agonist of group II metabotropic Doc_12231232_120_129_Chemical receptors.
12231232	1	141	The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 (mGluR1) and group II mGluRs, localized in the striatum, are involved in antiparkinsonian-like effects in rats.
12231232	2	334	Doc_12231232_334_345_Chemical (1 mg/kg ip) induced Doc_12231232_367_379_Disease-like Doc_12231232_385_400_Disease, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. Doc_12231232_512_551_Chemical (Doc_12231232_553_557_Chemical; 0.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist, or Doc_12231232_631_675_Chemical (Doc_12231232_677_687_Chemical; 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a selective group II agonist, was injected bilaterally into the striatum of Doc_12231232_792_803_Chemical-treated animals.

12448656	2	306	PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of Doc_12448656_368_379_Chemical using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule.
12448656	3	429	Patients began Doc_12448656_444_455_Chemical at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54.
12448656	4	519	Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3.
12448656	5	626	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients.
12448656	6	711	24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary Doc_12448656_848_858_Disease (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months.
12448656	7	926	Doc_12448656_926_936_Disease and Doc_12448656_941_953_Disease were prominent Doc_12448656_969_979_Disease and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level.
12448656	8	1045	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy.

12452237	2	261	One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner.
12452237	3	386	Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and Doc_12452237_442_457_Chemical 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, Doc_12452237_485_494_Chemical 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and Doc_12452237_515_530_Chemical 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and Doc_12452237_576_586_Chemical 0.6 mg x kg(-1).
12452237	4	604	Doc_12452237_604_612_Chemical 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry.
12452237	5	759	Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) Doc_12452237_799_809_Chemical iv. followed by Doc_12452237_826_841_Chemical (Group PS, LS) or Doc_12452237_860_870_Chemical (Group PR) for tracheal intubation.
12452237	6	907	Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of Doc_12452237_977_990_Disease were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered.
12452237	7	1098	The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions.
12452237	8	1182	Twenty-four hours later, any Doc_12452237_1211_1218_Disease experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management.
12452237	9	1378	The results indicate that Doc_12452237_1404_1424_Disease was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of Doc_12452237_1507_1527_Disease than those in Group PS (p < 0.001).
12452237	10	1564	At 24 h, the incidence of Doc_12452237_1590_1597_Disease was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05).

12745515	2	195	The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release Doc_12745515_366_375_Chemical as an active control.
12745515	3	398	After 5 weeks of Doc_12745515_415_424_Chemical use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic Doc_12745515_481_488_Disease after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence.
12745515	4	562	The patient had no other risk factors for Doc_12745515_604_612_Disease.
12745515	5	614	We suggest that Doc_12745515_630_647_Disease may add to the risk of Doc_12745515_671_680_Chemical-associated Doc_12745515_692_700_Disease.
12760988	0	0	Doc_12760988_0_21_Disease after Doc_12760988_28_43_Chemical: no evidence for an inflammatory origin.
12760988	1	85	A common side effect associated with Doc_12760988_122_137_Chemical is Doc_12760988_141_162_Disease.
12760988	2	164	The pathogenesis of this Doc_12760988_189_196_Disease is still unclear; Doc_12760988_215_227_Disease has been suggested but without convincing evidence.
12760988	3	280	We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this Doc_12760988_378_385_Disease.
12760988	4	387	The incidence and severity of Doc_12760988_417_432_Chemical-associated Doc_12760988_444_451_Disease was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or Doc_12760988_508_521_Chemical before Doc_12760988_529_544_Chemical (n = 32 for each).
12760988	5	564	Incidence and severity of Doc_12760988_590_597_Disease did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the Doc_12760988_670_683_Chemical group complained of Doc_12760988_704_711_Disease compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe Doc_12760988_770_777_Disease was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant).
12760988	6	860	At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from Doc_12760988_930_937_Disease (not significant).
12760988	7	957	In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of Doc_12760988_1013_1025_Disease was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline.
12760988	8	1092	We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported Doc_12760988_1176_1183_Disease; no relationship between Doc_12760988_1209_1216_Disease and the increase of IL-6 was found.
12760988	9	1253	In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of Doc_12760988_1319_1334_Chemical-associated Doc_12760988_1346_1353_Disease.
12760988	10	1355	Administration of Doc_12760988_1387_1400_Chemical before Doc_12760988_1408_1423_Chemical was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of Doc_12760988_1489_1504_Chemical-induced Doc_12760988_1513_1534_Disease.
12760988	11	1536	Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between Doc_12760988_1595_1616_Disease and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of Doc_12760988_1678_1690_Disease.
12760988	12	1692	Pretreatment with Doc_12760988_1710_1723_Chemical is not justified to prevent Doc_12760988_1752_1773_Disease after Doc_12760988_1780_1795_Chemical.
12842176	0	0	Effect of Doc_12842176_10_17_Chemical on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in Doc_12842176_92_99_Chemical induced Doc_12842176_108_121_Disease.
12842176	1	123	Oral administration of Doc_12842176_146_153_Chemical (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and Doc_12842176_367_389_Chemical demethylase (Doc_12842176_403_407_Chemical-d) in rat brain and liver.
12842176	2	435	A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of Doc_12842176_578_585_Chemical was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days.
12842176	3	630	As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain.
12842176	4	804	Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes.
12842176	5	974	In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and Doc_12842176_1170_1174_Chemical-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1/2B2, 1A1/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively.
12842176	6	1274	Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of Doc_12842176_1338_1358_Chemical (Doc_12842176_1360_1362_Chemical), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of Doc_12842176_1451_1458_Chemical induced Doc_12842176_1467_1478_Disease, pretreatment with Doc_12842176_1498_1511_Chemical (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or Doc_12842176_1548_1555_Chemical, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of Doc_12842176_1642_1649_Chemical induced Doc_12842176_1658_1669_Disease.
12842176	7	1671	Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of Doc_12842176_1719_1726_Chemical was blocked by Doc_12842176_1742_1757_Chemical incidence of Doc_12842176_1771_1782_Disease was increased in animals treated with Doc_12842176_1821_1828_Chemical indicating that Doc_12842176_1845_1852_Chemical per se or its metabolites formed by PB or Doc_12842176_1895_1902_Chemical inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral Doc_12842176_1965_1973_Disease.

12851669	5	631	During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had Doc_12851669_709_712_Disease while on Doc_12851669_722_726_Chemical.
12851669	6	728	Of these women, 67 were on Doc_12851669_755_769_Chemical-containing Doc_12851669_781_785_Chemical.
12851669	7	787	Eleven were on Doc_12851669_802_805_Chemical/Doc_12851669_806_808_Chemical.
12851669	8	810	The corresponding absolute risk of Doc_12851669_845_848_Disease was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on Doc_12851669_916_920_Chemical, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on Doc_12851669_981_995_Chemical-containing Doc_12851669_1007_1011_Chemical, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on Doc_12851669_1080_1083_Chemical/Doc_12851669_1084_1086_Chemical.

12852481	1	114	Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of Doc_12852481_236_259_Disease occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis.
12852481	2	327	Doc_12852481_327_334_Chemical (Doc_12852481_336_356_Chemical [Doc_12852481_358_361_Chemical]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces Doc_12852481_423_446_Disease when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ.
12852481	3	555	Teratology 4:15-24, 1971).
12852481	4	582	There are no published Doc_12852481_605_608_Chemical studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17.
12852481	5	668	Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when Doc_12852481_776_779_Chemical is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal Doc_12852481_965_990_Disease confounds the detection of low incidence Doc_12852481_1032_1045_Disease with Doc_12852481_1051_1054_Chemical when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.
12852481	6	1096	Doc_12852481_1105_1108_Chemical was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats.
12852481	7	1342	Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally.
12852481	8	1410	The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce Doc_12852481_1474_1500_Disease (Doc_12852481_1502_1506_Disease) and Doc_12852481_1512_1527_Disease (Doc_12852481_1529_1532_Disease) in rats and Doc_12852481_1546_1566_Disease (Doc_12852481_1568_1570_Disease), Doc_12852481_1573_1576_Disease, and Doc_12852481_1582_1586_Disease in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these Doc_12852481_1664_1677_Disease, even though Doc_12852481_1691_1694_Chemical induces several other low-incidence Doc_12852481_1731_1744_Disease.
12852481	9	1746	In single dose studies, Doc_12852481_1770_1772_Disease, Doc_12852481_1774_1776_Disease, and Doc_12852481_1782_1785_Disease were induced on GDs 9 and 10.
12852481	10	1816	Doc_12852481_1816_1819_Disease also was noted following treatment on GD 11.
12852481	11	1865	In contrast, Doc_12852481_1878_1880_Disease and Doc_12852481_1885_1887_Disease were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and Doc_12852481_1966_1969_Disease was noted across all dose groups.
12852481	12	2004	High concordance in major Doc_12852481_2043_2066_Disease between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of Doc_12852481_2127_2130_Disease in the SD rats and Doc_12852481_2150_2163_Disease in the Wistar rats.
12852481	13	2184	Variations and Doc_12852481_2199_2212_Disease were similar when Doc_12852481_2231_2234_Chemical was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17).
12852481	14	2322	It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, Doc_12852481_2407_2420_Disease that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with Doc_12852481_2533_2536_Chemical given at multiple doses.

133615	4	401	Significant increases in certain factors of the Doc_133615_449_466_Disease and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups.
133615	5	579	Severe complications developed in four patients.
133615	6	628	All four had an abnormal Doc_133615_653_670_Disease profile, suggesting "Doc_133615_692_710_Disease" before initiation of therapy.
133615	7	742	Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy.
133615	8	885	One of these patients developed a Doc_133615_919_940_Disease before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained.
133615	9	1024	One patient developed Doc_133615_1046_1057_Disease 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed Doc_133615_1115_1131_Disease after 27 months of therapy.
133615	10	1160	The fourth patient developed Doc_133615_1189_1205_Disease 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy.
133615	11	1257	All four patients were of the A or AB blood group.
133615	12	1308	Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for Doc_133615_1380_1403_Disease in patients possessing the A antigen.
133615	13	1442	It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term Doc_133615_1551_1569_Chemical therapy.
1355091	0	0	Doc_1355091_0_23_Disease occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic Doc_1355091_82_90_Chemical-pretreated conscious spontaneously Doc_1355091_126_138_Disease rats. 1.
1355091	1	148	Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic Doc_1355091_199_207_Chemical treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously Doc_1355091_337_349_Disease rats (SHR). 2.
1355091	2	365	Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of Doc_1355091_482_490_Chemical (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or Doc_1355091_513_524_Chemical (3 mg kg-1 i.v.).
1355091	3	543	Doc_1355091_543_566_Disease was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period.
1355091	4	677	The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by Doc_1355091_743_751_Chemical (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and Doc_1355091_774_785_Chemical (-16%(-)-33% MAP).
1355091	5	805	However, the head-up tilt induced Doc_1355091_839_862_Disease in the SHR treated with Doc_1355091_887_895_Chemical (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with Doc_1355091_947_958_Chemical (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3.
1355091	6	990	Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with Doc_1355091_1033_1041_Chemical at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.
1355091	7	1109	MAP in conscious SHR after chronic Doc_1355091_1144_1152_Chemical treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8).
1355091	8	1212	Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce Doc_1355091_1256_1279_Disease when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of Doc_1355091_1336_1344_Chemical (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.).
1355091	9	1365	Conversely, administration of Doc_1355091_1395_1406_Chemical (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic Doc_1355091_1435_1443_Chemical treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4.
1355091	10	1577	The pressor responses and Doc_1355091_1603_1614_Disease to the alpha 1-agonist Doc_1355091_1638_1648_Chemical (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Doc_1355091_1703_1715_Chemical (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and Doc_1355091_1752_1765_Chemical (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic Doc_1355091_1859_1867_Chemical pretreatment.
1355091	11	1882	Both the pressor and Doc_1355091_1903_1914_Disease effects of Doc_1355091_1926_1936_Chemical were abolished in chronic Doc_1355091_1963_1971_Chemical treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4).
1355091	12	2034	On the other hand, the pressor effects of Doc_1355091_2076_2088_Chemical were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying Doc_1355091_2146_2157_Disease was greater in SHR with chronic Doc_1355091_2190_2198_Chemical treatment than without such treatment.
1355091	13	2238	Furthermore, the Doc_1355091_2255_2266_Disease that accompanied the Doc_1355091_2288_2301_Chemical-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic Doc_1355091_2369_2377_Chemical treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1415380	0	0	Doc_1415380_0_25_Disease associated with ingestion of Doc_1415380_55_62_Chemical.
1415380	1	64	Doc_1415380_64_89_Disease following Doc_1415380_100_107_Chemical ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature.
1415380	2	217	We describe a 5th case.
1415380	3	241	The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of Doc_1415380_346_353_Chemical.
1415380	4	355	Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, Doc_1415380_402_412_Chemical, Doc_1415380_414_421_Chemical, and Doc_1415380_427_439_Chemical.
1415380	5	441	The patients have all regained some degree of renal function.
1415380	6	503	However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement.
1415380	7	622	Doc_1415380_622_629_Chemical-associated Doc_1415380_641_666_Disease probably occurs more often than is recognized.
1415380	8	714	It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further Doc_1415380_793_800_Chemical exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.

1423339	2	171	Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities.
1423339	3	292	There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug Doc_1423339_342_350_Disease can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain.
1445986	0	0	Doc_1445986_0_9_Chemical-induced immune Doc_1445986_25_41_Disease.
1445986	1	43	Immune Doc_1445986_50_66_Disease due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving Doc_1445986_153_164_Chemical and first-generation Doc_1445986_186_200_Chemical.
1445986	2	202	We describe a patient who developed Doc_1445986_238_244_Disease while receiving intravenous Doc_1445986_273_282_Chemical.
1445986	3	284	Doc_1445986_284_293_Chemical-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells.
1445986	4	404	The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of Doc_1445986_474_483_Chemical, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies.
1445986	5	555	These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular Doc_1445986_645_654_Disease, are consistent with drug-induced Doc_1445986_689_705_Disease, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms.
1445986	6	786	This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all Doc_1445986_870_884_Chemical.

14633084	1	95	Doc_14633084_100_120_Disease (Doc_14633084_122_124_Disease) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with Doc_14633084_173_183_Chemical (Doc_14633084_185_188_Chemical).
14633084	2	191	In the study presented here, we investigated the use of Doc_14633084_247_260_Chemical in combination with Doc_14633084_281_286_Chemical for the prevention of Doc_14633084_309_312_Chemical-induced Doc_14633084_321_323_Disease.
14633084	3	325	Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or Doc_14633084_409_414_Chemical 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of Doc_14633084_480_483_Chemical.
14633084	4	485	One, two or three doses of Doc_14633084_512_517_Chemical were replaced with Doc_14633084_537_550_Chemical alone or with Doc_14633084_565_578_Chemical plus Doc_14633084_584_589_Chemical.
14633084	5	591	Doc_14633084_591_599_Disease was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis.
14633084	6	721	The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of Doc_14633084_788_793_Chemical with Doc_14633084_799_812_Chemical reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by Doc_14633084_867_870_Chemical by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively.
14633084	7	907	In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by Doc_14633084_995_998_Chemical.
14633084	8	1000	Moreover, the addition of Doc_14633084_1026_1039_Chemical to the last two doses of Doc_14633084_1065_1070_Chemical was more efficient than three doses of Doc_14633084_1110_1115_Chemical alone when evaluated microscopically.
14633084	9	1154	Doc_14633084_1166_1179_Chemical in combination with Doc_14633084_1200_1205_Chemical was efficient in blocking Doc_14633084_1232_1235_Chemical-induced Doc_14633084_1244_1246_Disease.
14633084	10	1248	However, the replacement of last two doses of Doc_14633084_1294_1299_Chemical with saline or all of the Doc_14633084_1326_1331_Chemical doses with Doc_14633084_1343_1356_Chemical did not prevent Doc_14633084_1373_1375_Disease.

14648024	4	457	The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with Doc_14648024_517_533_Disease.
14648024	5	535	All patients received short course of Doc_14648024_573_581_Chemical.
14648024	6	583	Doc_14648024_583_588_Disease subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely.
14648024	7	649	All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of Doc_14648024_712_716_Chemical.
14648024	8	718	Doc_14648024_718_722_Chemical seemed to be the most possible etiology of Doc_14648024_766_782_Disease in our patients.
14648024	9	800	Short-term use of Doc_14648024_818_825_Chemical is very effective in Doc_14648024_847_851_Chemical-induced Doc_14648024_860_876_Disease.
14704468	0	0	Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of Doc_14704468_57_68_Chemical and its combinations with Doc_14704468_95_104_Chemical or Doc_14704468_108_118_Chemical in amygdala-kindled rats.
14704468	1	145	Doc_14704468_145_156_Chemical (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both Doc_14704468_247_254_Disease and afterdischarge durations.
14704468	2	285	The combinations of Doc_14704468_305_316_Chemical (2.5 mg/kg) with Doc_14704468_334_343_Chemical, Doc_14704468_345_355_Chemical, or Doc_14704468_360_373_Chemical (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test.
14704468	3	461	However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature.
14704468	4	540	Among several chemoconvulsants, Doc_14704468_572_583_Chemical, Doc_14704468_585_609_Chemical and Doc_14704468_614_624_Chemical (the opener of L-type Doc_14704468_647_654_Chemical channels) reversed the protective activity of Doc_14704468_701_712_Chemical alone and its combination with Doc_14704468_744_753_Chemical.
14704468	5	755	On the other hand, Doc_14704468_774_785_Chemical, Doc_14704468_787_800_Chemical and Doc_14704468_805_815_Chemical inhibited the anticonvulsive action of Doc_14704468_855_866_Chemical combined with Doc_14704468_881_891_Chemical.
14704468	6	893	The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of Doc_14704468_960_971_Chemical and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of Doc_14704468_1101_1108_Chemical channels.

14736955	2	231	We investigated the potential role of Doc_14736955_269_289_Disease in the onset of these lesions.
14736955	3	321	Rats were treated with intravenous Doc_14736955_365_376_Chemical (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose.
14736955	4	512	Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia.
14736955	5	593	All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age.
14736955	6	634	Doc_14736955_634_663_Disease was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components.
14736955	7	756	Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as Doc_14736955_833_843_Chemical production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion.
14736955	8	903	The 'long-term' group had significant Doc_14736955_950_980_Disease, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased Doc_14736955_1084_1091_Chemical synthase activity.
14736955	9	1111	In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased.
14736955	10	1215	In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer Doc_14736955_1254_1269_Disease, but similar numbers of Doc_14736955_1294_1312_Disease activity.
14736955	11	1323	Among all animals, Doc_14736955_1342_1371_Disease were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I.
14736955	12	1538	Injury was positively correlated with Doc_14736955_1576_1586_Chemical production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes.
14736955	13	1674	Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups.
14736955	14	1815	These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of Doc_14736955_2002_2012_Chemical in Doc_14736955_2016_2027_Chemical-induced Doc_14736955_2036_2049_Disease.

14745746	4	414	Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups.
14745746	5	642	Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity.
14745746	6	761	The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of Doc_14745746_896_909_Disease.
14745746	7	911	Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in Doc_14745746_967_976_Chemical levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women.
14745746	8	1073	In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.

15075188	6	709	The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM.
15075188	7	950	Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments.

15517007	7	811	However, caution is required when Doc_15517007_845_861_Chemical or Doc_15517007_865_879_Chemical such as Doc_15517007_888_900_Chemical are used in patients with a possible underlying Doc_15517007_949_961_Disease, for example, Doc_15517007_976_994_Disease patients.
15517007	8	1005	In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine.
15517007	9	1202	The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Doc_15517007_1346_1364_Disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients.
15517007	10	1424	A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.

15531665	1	89	Doc_15531665_101_110_Chemical acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro.
15531665	2	236	These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of Doc_15531665_299_308_Chemical in Doc_15531665_312_320_Disease persons might promote Doc_15531665_343_358_Disease.
15531665	3	360	The objective was to examine the relation between Doc_15531665_421_430_Chemical intake and mortality from Doc_15531665_457_479_Disease.
15531665	4	481	We studied the relation between Doc_15531665_521_530_Chemical intake and mortality from total Doc_15531665_563_585_Disease (n = 281), Doc_15531665_597_620_Disease (n = 175), and Doc_15531665_636_642_Disease (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being Doc_15531665_700_708_Disease at baseline.
15531665	5	722	Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of Doc_15531665_820_843_Disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for Doc_15531665_912_934_Disease risk factors, type of Doc_15531665_957_965_Disease medication used, duration of Doc_15531665_995_1003_Disease, and intakes of Doc_15531665_1020_1026_Chemical, Doc_15531665_1028_1037_Chemical, and Doc_15531665_1043_1056_Chemical, the adjusted relative risks of total Doc_15531665_1095_1117_Disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total Doc_15531665_1212_1221_Chemical intake from food and supplements.
15531665	6	1256	Adjusted relative risks of Doc_15531665_1283_1306_Disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of Doc_15531665_1372_1378_Disease were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01).
15531665	7	1438	When dietary and supplemental Doc_15531665_1468_1477_Chemical were analyzed separately, only supplemental Doc_15531665_1522_1531_Chemical showed a positive association with mortality endpoints.
15531665	8	1588	Doc_15531665_1588_1597_Chemical intake was unrelated to mortality from Doc_15531665_1637_1659_Disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline.
15531665	9	1701	A high Doc_15531665_1720_1729_Chemical intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of Doc_15531665_1794_1816_Disease mortality in postmenopausal women with Doc_15531665_1856_1864_Disease.

15565293	5	607	Three subjects with a history of Doc_15565293_649_659_Chemical (Doc_15565293_661_664_Chemical)-induced Doc_15565293_674_690_Disease of short-, intermediate-, and long-term Doc_15565293_731_746_Disease were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination.
15565293	6	890	In addition, OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey-Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis protocol.
15565293	7	1051	OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL.
15565293	8	1145	The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n=661.

15580403	4	522	Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed Doc_15580403_657_663_Disease with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or Doc_15580403_698_704_Disease-related signs during therapy.
15580403	5	735	After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of Doc_15580403_792_801_Chemical (200 mg) per day.
15580403	6	820	After reduction of Doc_15580403_839_848_Chemical, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A).
15580403	7	938	However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of Doc_15580403_983_992_Chemical could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or Doc_15580403_1090_1096_Disease-related severe side effects occurred (group B).
15580403	8	1145	We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of Doc_15580403_1206_1215_Chemical in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively.
15580403	9	1352	A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance.

1564236	2	440	The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of Doc_1564236_662_679_Disease.
1564236	3	681	The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with Doc_1564236_838_846_Chemical-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).
1564236	4	894	During a transient (20-s) Doc_1564236_920_938_Disease, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced.

15858223	1	124	A single dose of Doc_15858223_141_154_Chemical (Doc_15858223_156_159_Chemical), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of Doc_15858223_297_317_Chemical (Doc_15858223_319_332_Chemical).
15858223	2	335	To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between Doc_15858223_398_401_Chemical-associated oxidative stress and Doc_15858223_434_448_Disease, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with Doc_15858223_502_505_Chemical (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days.
15858223	3	583	Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of Doc_15858223_655_668_Chemical, Doc_15858223_670_690_Chemical (Doc_15858223_692_695_Chemical), and Doc_15858223_702_741_Chemical (Doc_15858223_743_748_Chemical).
15858223	4	751	Plasma and liver Doc_15858223_768_781_Chemical were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of Doc_15858223_833_836_Chemical treatment compared to control.
15858223	5	868	Liver Doc_15858223_874_877_Chemical levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05).
15858223	6	965	Liver and plasma Doc_15858223_982_987_Chemical were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05).
15858223	7	1053	Doc_15858223_1053_1067_Disease was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-Doc_15858223_1113_1124_Chemical S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology.
15858223	8	1169	Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to Doc_15858223_1252_1266_Disease as shown by the increasing incidence of Doc_15858223_1307_1319_Disease of the liver capsule, Doc_15858223_1342_1350_Disease, and Doc_15858223_1356_1365_Disease throughout the study.
15858223	9	1388	The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of Doc_15858223_1438_1441_Chemical were decreased by day 14, while the levels of Doc_15858223_1488_1497_Chemical and (E)-Doc_15858223_1506_1519_Chemical were not elevated throughout the study.
15858223	10	1560	Overall, these findings indicate that Doc_15858223_1598_1601_Chemical treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of Doc_15858223_1666_1679_Chemical, which precedes the onset of Doc_15858223_1709_1717_Disease, Doc_15858223_1719_1728_Disease, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.

15867025	4	750	Prenatal screening rates for Doc_15867025_788_799_Disease (98.8%) and Doc_15867025_812_819_Disease (99.4%) were high.
15867025	5	839	Doc_15867025_839_850_Disease vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants.
15867025	6	912	All infants who were born to Doc_15867025_941_968_Chemical-positive mothers also received Doc_15867025_1000_1011_Disease immune globulin.
15867025	7	1029	Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of Doc_15867025_1151_1162_Disease vaccination.
15867025	8	1176	The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest.
15867025	9	1400	Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of Doc_15867025_1466_1473_Disease nonimmunity (9.5%).

15897593	2	373	Doc_15897593_373_384_Chemical (Doc_15897593_386_394_Chemical) is recommended for protection against Doc_15897593_434_447_Chemical-induced Doc_15897593_456_470_Disease.
15897593	3	472	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the Doc_15897593_530_550_Disease following coadministration of Doc_15897593_581_592_Chemical and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to Doc_15897593_731_740_Chemical, Doc_15897593_742_754_Chemical, and Doc_15897593_760_771_Chemical +/- Doc_15897593_776_787_Chemical was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays.
15897593	4	852	Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with Doc_15897593_901_910_Chemical, Doc_15897593_912_924_Chemical, and Doc_15897593_930_941_Chemical, with or without Doc_15897593_959_970_Chemical over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.
15897593	5	1054	Nontoxic doses of Doc_15897593_1081_1092_Chemical reduced Doc_15897593_1101_1117_Disease and Doc_15897593_1122_1133_Disease from Doc_15897593_1139_1151_Chemical and Doc_15897593_1156_1165_Chemical in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, Doc_15897593_1252_1263_Chemical neither reduced Doc_15897593_1280_1296_Disease, Doc_15897593_1298_1309_Disease, nor the in vitro Doc_15897593_1328_1340_Disease from Doc_15897593_1346_1357_Chemical.
15897593	6	1359	Although our findings support the observation that Doc_15897593_1422_1433_Chemical reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from Doc_15897593_1499_1510_Chemical clinically, the potent antagonism of Doc_15897593_1548_1560_Chemical activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.
15897593	7	1679	Our data also suggest that significant Doc_15897593_1718_1727_Chemical dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of Doc_15897593_1778_1789_Chemical.

15930398	1	93	To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with Doc_15930398_220_228_Chemical, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring.
15930398	2	337	This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with Doc_15930398_461_469_Chemical between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003.
15930398	3	519	BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status.
15930398	4	658	At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator.
15930398	5	917	The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded.
15930398	6	1021	After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.
15930398	7	1281	Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation.
15930398	8	1408	No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations.
15930398	9	1478	The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes).
15930398	10	1585	The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99).
15930398	11	1662	The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91).
15930398	12	1768	The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0).
15930398	13	1919	The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the Doc_15930398_1967_1992_Disease was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8).
15930398	14	2027	The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98).
15930398	15	2166	The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3).
15930398	16	2294	All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol.
15930398	17	2382	The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90.
15930398	18	2544	There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words.
15930398	19	2709	Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of Doc_15930398_2870_2888_Disease.

15985056	2	128	CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent Doc_15985056_186_193_Disease after beginning Doc_15985056_210_222_Chemical for the treatment of Doc_15985056_244_255_Disease.
15985056	3	257	Doc_15985056_257_264_Disease were persistent and exhausting.
15985056	4	297	Discontinuation of Doc_15985056_316_328_Chemical and therapy with Doc_15985056_346_354_Chemical finally resolved Doc_15985056_372_379_Disease.
15985056	5	381	No organic cause of Doc_15985056_401_408_Disease was identified despite extensive investigation.
15985056	6	457	Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with Doc_15985056_533_540_Disease.
15985056	7	542	Corticosteroids (Doc_15985056_559_572_Chemical and Doc_15985056_577_595_Chemical), Doc_15985056_598_613_Chemical (Doc_15985056_615_624_Chemical) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of Doc_15985056_768_775_Disease.
15985056	8	777	Few cases of drug-induced Doc_15985056_803_810_Disease have been reported related to Doc_15985056_841_850_Chemical antimicrobials.
15985056	9	867	Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other Doc_15985056_1080_1090_Chemical and the absence of any alternative explanation for Doc_15985056_1142_1149_Disease.
15985056	10	1151	Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by Doc_15985056_1204_1216_Chemical could be the pathogenesis of Doc_15985056_1246_1253_Disease in our patient.
15985056	11	1270	Diagnosis of drug-induced Doc_15985056_1309_1316_Disease is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination.

16006300	1	110	To describe 3 patients with Doc_16006300_149_166_Chemical-induced Doc_16006300_175_188_Disease and gain insights into the cause and management of the Doc_16006300_244_264_Disease.
16006300	2	266	We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe Doc_16006300_358_371_Disease (corrected serum Doc_16006300_389_396_Chemical > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on Doc_16006300_453_473_Disease.
16006300	3	475	The 3 patients had Doc_16006300_503_528_Disease, relative Doc_16006300_539_558_Disease, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and Doc_16006300_620_643_Chemical concentrations.
16006300	4	660	No malignant lesion was found.
16006300	5	691	Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of Doc_16006300_753_763_Chemical.
16006300	6	765	The 2 patients with the higher serum Doc_16006300_802_809_Chemical concentrations received Doc_16006300_834_845_Chemical intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe Doc_16006300_910_922_Disease.
16006300	7	924	Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental Doc_16006300_990_997_Chemical (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of Doc_16006300_1047_1064_Chemical.
16006300	8	1066	In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of Doc_16006300_1187_1207_Disease and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003.
16006300	9	1275	Doc_16006300_1287_1307_Disease may be a common cause of unexplained Doc_16006300_1345_1358_Disease and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested Doc_16006300_1419_1436_Chemical in susceptible persons.
16006300	10	1461	Treatment with hydration, Doc_16006300_1487_1497_Chemical, and discontinuation of the Doc_16006300_1526_1533_Chemical and Doc_16006300_1538_1547_Chemical source is adequate.
16006300	11	1568	Doc_16006300_1568_1579_Chemical treatment is associated with considerable risk for Doc_16006300_1631_1643_Disease, even in cases of initially severe Doc_16006300_1679_1692_Disease.

16047871	2	142	Doc_16047871_142_169_Disease (Doc_16047871_171_173_Disease) is primarily a Doc_16047871_190_223_Disease, though systemic involvement may be encountered.
16047871	3	273	We report 4 patients with late-onset Doc_16047871_310_312_Disease probably due to Doc_16047871_329_337_Chemical.
16047871	4	339	All 4 patients presented with Doc_16047871_369_383_Disease that developed after receiving Doc_16047871_415_423_Chemical for several years.
16047871	5	443	The results of Doc_16047871_458_469_Disease biopsies were available in 3 patients, confirming Doc_16047871_520_540_Disease resolved in all patients after Doc_16047871_572_580_Chemical was discontinued.
16047871	6	599	In 2 of the 4 patients, rechallenge with Doc_16047871_640_648_Chemical led to recurrence of the lesions.
16047871	7	683	Doc_16047871_683_685_Disease may be a late-onset adverse reaction associated with Doc_16047871_739_747_Chemical therapy.
1610717	0	0	Doc_1610717_0_7_Chemical-induced brainstem Doc_1610717_26_34_Disease and behavior.
1610717	1	49	A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of Doc_1610717_319_326_Chemical.
1610717	2	328	The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations.
1610717	3	481	Doc_1610717_481_488_Chemical (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study.
1610717	4	625	Doc_1610717_625_632_Chemical generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects.
1610717	5	754	The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, Doc_1610717_804_817_Disease, Doc_1610717_819_835_Disease, "beating drum" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching.
1610717	6	949	Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states.
1610717	7	1068	Doc_1610717_1068_1084_Disease to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation.
1610717	8	1256	These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation.
1610717	9	1414	Doc_1610717_1414_1421_Chemical was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates.
1610717	10	1597	Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.

16132524	1	137	Human malignant Doc_16132524_153_165_Disease have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy.
16132524	2	231	Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels.
16132524	3	345	Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel-like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity.
16132524	4	468	For human Doc_16132524_478_490_Disease recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of Doc_16132524_595_605_Chemical and Doc_16132524_610_621_Chemical encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study.
16132524	5	701	A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a Doc_16132524_747_759_Disease multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of Doc_16132524_839_849_Chemical and Doc_16132524_854_865_Chemical cubic phases in different dosages.
16132524	6	901	Six of the patients received more than 15 mg Doc_16132524_946_956_Chemical and suffered from moderate to severe Doc_16132524_994_1005_Disease, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg Doc_16132524_1067_1077_Chemical.
16132524	7	1079	In the latter group, Doc_16132524_1100_1111_Disease was markedly reduced and dealt medically.
16132524	8	1154	Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent Doc_16132524_1194_1206_Disease using cubic phases is feasible and safe, yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study.

16174948	2	225	However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of Doc_16174948_283_290_Chemical on human cerebral arteries.
16174948	3	319	Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with Doc_16174948_399_406_Chemical-associated Doc_16174948_418_441_Disease (Doc_16174948_443_446_Disease) who underwent angiography shortly after Doc_16174948_488_495_Chemical use.
16174948	4	501	We screened patients with Doc_16174948_536_539_Disease retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for Doc_16174948_612_619_Chemical or its metabolites.
16174948	5	640	Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with Doc_16174948_775_778_Disease who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter.
16174948	6	846	Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made.
16174948	7	910	Thirteen patients with positive Doc_16174948_951_958_Chemical toxicology were compared to 26 controls.

16192988	3	403	This increase in Doc_16192988_420_434_Disease was not secondary to Doc_16192988_456_460_Chemical-induced Doc_16192988_469_482_Disease.
16192988	4	484	Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single Doc_16192988_650_654_Chemical injections.
16192988	5	667	There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of Doc_16192988_820_824_Chemical.
16192988	6	826	MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of Doc_16192988_892_896_Chemical, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of Doc_16192988_960_964_Chemical.

16634859	1	98	More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by Doc_16634859_197_204_Chemical exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged.
16634859	2	310	Early identification of fetal Doc_16634859_340_347_Chemical exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes.

16634859	4	511	We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief Doc_16634859_660_667_Chemical intervention study.
16634859	5	688	The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies.
16634859	6	872	Because intensity of Doc_16634859_893_900_Chemical consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) Doc_16634859_1045_1052_Chemical consumers.
16634859	7	1064	Fetal measures from the heavy-exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics.
16634859	8	1247	Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and Doc_16634859_1395_1405_Disease.
16634859	9	1407	Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies.
16634859	10	1500	When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-Doc_16634859_1630_1637_Chemical-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns.
16634859	11	1692	Any Doc_16634859_1696_1703_Chemical consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in Doc_16634859_1779_1804_Disease as well as Doc_16634859_1816_1848_Disease in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers.
16634859	12	1924	Doc_16634859_1924_1935_Chemical abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios.
16634859	13	1998	Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies.
16634859	14	2171	Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal Doc_16634859_2378_2385_Chemical effects.

1711760	1	91	The effect of induced Doc_1711760_113_125_Disease instituted after a 2-h delay following Doc_1711760_165_197_Disease (Doc_1711760_199_203_Disease) on Doc_1711760_208_219_Disease formation and histochemical injury was studied.
1711760	2	268	Under Doc_1711760_274_284_Chemical anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously Doc_1711760_325_337_Disease rats was occluded.
1711760	3	357	In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated.
1711760	4	441	In the Doc_1711760_448_460_Disease group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after Doc_1711760_532_536_Disease.
1711760	5	538	Four hours after Doc_1711760_555_559_Disease, the rats were killed and the brains harvested.
1711760	6	608	The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of Doc_1711760_684_692_Disease produced by Doc_1711760_705_709_Disease.
1711760	7	711	Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the Doc_1711760_823_831_Disease territory).
1711760	8	844	The extent of Doc_1711760_858_873_Disease was determined by Doc_1711760_892_918_Chemical staining.
1711760	9	929	In the Doc_1711760_936_944_Disease core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.
1711760	10	1028	In the periphery of the Doc_1711760_1052_1060_Disease territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less Doc_1711760_1107_1112_Disease accumulation) in the Doc_1711760_1134_1146_Disease group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05).
1711760	11	1209	The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the Doc_1711760_1319_1331_Disease group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05).
1711760	12	1382	The data indicate that Doc_1711760_1405_1418_Chemical-induced Doc_1711760_1427_1439_Disease instituted 2 h after Doc_1711760_1461_1465_Disease does not aggravate Doc_1711760_1485_1490_Disease in the Doc_1711760_1498_1506_Disease core, that it improves Doc_1711760_1530_1535_Disease in the periphery of the Doc_1711760_1560_1568_Disease territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical Doc_1711760_1626_1646_Disease.
17194457	0	0	Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic Doc_17194457_51_58_Chemical exposure in male rats with low Doc_17194457_90_99_Chemical.
17194457	1	101	The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic Doc_17194457_193_200_Chemical (AAS) exposure and brain Doc_17194457_226_235_Chemical (Doc_17194457_237_256_Chemical, Doc_17194457_258_262_Chemical) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats.
17194457	2	309	Doc_17194457_309_318_Chemical was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with Doc_17194457_367_390_Chemical (Doc_17194457_392_396_Chemical 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline.
17194457	3	452	At puberty (P40), half the Doc_17194457_479_483_Chemical-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with Doc_17194457_551_563_Chemical (Doc_17194457_565_566_Chemical, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week).
17194457	4	591	Behavioral measures included locomotion, Doc_17194457_632_644_Disease, copulation, partner preference, and Doc_17194457_682_692_Disease.
17194457	5	694	Animals were tested for Doc_17194457_718_728_Disease in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch).
17194457	6	811	Brain levels of Doc_17194457_827_831_Chemical and its metabolite, Doc_17194457_852_878_Chemical (Doc_17194457_880_886_Chemical), were determined using HPLC.
17194457	7	917	Doc_17194457_917_921_Chemical significantly and substantially depleted Doc_17194457_963_967_Chemical and Doc_17194457_972_978_Chemical in all brain regions examined.
17194457	8	1010	Chronic Doc_17194457_1018_1019_Chemical treatment significantly decreased Doc_17194457_1054_1058_Chemical and Doc_17194457_1063_1069_Chemical in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than Doc_17194457_1127_1131_Chemical.
17194457	9	1133	Chronic exposure to Doc_17194457_1153_1157_Chemical alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased Doc_17194457_1221_1233_Disease but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or Doc_17194457_1295_1305_Disease.
17194457	10	1307	Doc_17194457_1307_1308_Chemical alone had no effect on locomotion, Doc_17194457_1344_1356_Disease, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and Doc_17194457_1414_1424_Disease.
17194457	11	1426	The most striking effect of combining Doc_17194457_1464_1465_Chemical+Doc_17194457_1466_1470_Chemical was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation.
17194457	12	1623	Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central Doc_17194457_1706_1710_Chemical may be especially prone to exhibit Doc_17194457_1746_1765_Disease.
17241657	0	0	Effects of Doc_17241657_11_16_Chemical and (+/-)-Doc_17241657_27_32_Chemical, putative sigma2-preferring antagonists, on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of Doc_17241657_119_126_Chemical in mice.
17241657	1	136	Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the Doc_17241657_221_231_Disease, lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of Doc_17241657_288_295_Chemical in mice.
17241657	2	305	In contrast, the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable.
17241657	3	445	To begin addressing this need, we characterized Doc_17241657_493_498_Chemical (Doc_17241657_500_540_Chemical) and (+/-)-Doc_17241657_552_557_Chemical (Doc_17241657_559_601_Chemical) in receptor binding and behavioral studies.
17241657	4	647	Receptor binding studies confirmed that Doc_17241657_687_692_Chemical and (+/-)-Doc_17241657_703_708_Chemical display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors.
17241657	5	773	In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with Doc_17241657_836_841_Chemical or (+/-)-Doc_17241657_851_856_Chemical significantly attenuated Doc_17241657_882_889_Chemical-induced Doc_17241657_898_909_Disease and locomotor activity, but not lethality.
17241657	6	953	When administered alone, (+/-)-Doc_17241657_984_989_Chemical produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but Doc_17241657_1068_1073_Chemical had locomotor depressant actions.
17241657	7	1108	Together, the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of Doc_17241657_1234_1241_Chemical, and further development of more selective, high affinity ligands are warranted.
17263743	0	0	Doc_17263743_0_14_Disease in a child with Doc_17263743_31_45_Disease undergoing Doc_17263743_57_68_Chemical induction of anesthesia after preoperative Doc_17263743_112_121_Chemical.
17263743	1	123	Doc_17263743_123_132_Chemical is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure.
17263743	2	238	We present a case of a 5-year-old child with Doc_17263743_283_297_Disease and Doc_17263743_302_318_Disease, receiving Doc_17263743_330_339_Chemical for Doc_17263743_344_356_Disease, who presented for placement of a Doc_17263743_391_399_Chemical pump.
17263743	3	406	Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of Doc_17263743_503_512_Chemical during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce Doc_17263743_572_579_Disease.
17263743	4	581	During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed Doc_17263743_635_646_Disease and Doc_17263743_651_662_Disease requiring cardiac resuscitation.
17263743	5	696	There are no previous reports of Doc_17263743_729_738_Chemical-associated Doc_17263743_750_764_Disease in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.
17285209	0	0	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated Doc_17285209_57_67_Disease of the stomach and small intestine: a case report.
17285209	1	119	This is a case report on a 45-year old African-American female with newly diagnosed Doc_17285209_203_215_Disease, who was started on a combination pill of Doc_17285209_258_268_Chemical/Doc_17285209_269_279_Chemical 10/5 mg.
17285209	2	289	The very next day, she presented at the emergency room (ER) with Doc_17285209_354_368_Disease, Doc_17285209_370_376_Disease and Doc_17285209_381_389_Disease.
17285209	3	391	Physical exam, complete metabolic panel, and hemogram were in the normal range.
17285209	4	471	She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics.
17285209	5	560	However, she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints.
17285209	6	631	This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion.
17285209	7	728	CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum, along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity.
17285209	8	877	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced Doc_17285209_932_942_Disease was suspected, and anti-Doc_17285209_967_979_Disease medications were discontinued.
17285209	9	1011	Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours, and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of Doc_17285209_1172_1179_Disease.
17285209	10	1181	The recognition of Doc_17285209_1200_1211_Chemical-converting enzyme (ACE) and Doc_17285209_1240_1251_Chemical receptor blocker (ARB) Doc_17285209_1275_1296_Disease constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians, internists, emergency room personal and surgeons.

1728915	1	43	Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.
1728915	2	96	A patient with sinus Doc_1728915_117_128_Disease and Doc_1728915_133_155_Disease, induced by Doc_1728915_168_181_Chemical, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases.
1728915	3	257	From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of Doc_1728915_313_326_Chemical-associated Doc_1728915_338_357_Disease emerged.
1728915	4	367	One patient group developed Doc_1728915_395_413_Disease in the setting of a massive Doc_1728915_442_455_Chemical Doc_1728915_456_464_Disease.
1728915	5	466	The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening Doc_1728915_572_588_Disease or Doc_1728915_592_625_Disease, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated Doc_1728915_683_696_Chemical serum levels.
1728915	6	711	Because Doc_1728915_719_732_Chemical is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and Doc_1728915_788_799_Disease conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.
1732442	0	0	Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in Doc_1732442_60_70_Chemical-induced Doc_1732442_79_93_Disease with Doc_1732442_99_133_Chemical.
1732442	1	135	Doc_1732442_135_171_Chemical (Doc_1732442_173_177_Chemical), an analog of Doc_1732442_193_207_Chemical (Doc_1732442_209_211_Chemical), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function.
1732442	2	278	Using a rat model of Doc_1732442_299_309_Chemical-induced Doc_1732442_318_332_Disease, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in Doc_1732442_458_468_Chemical Doc_1732442_469_483_Disease.
1732442	3	485	The degree of Doc_1732442_499_540_Disease was analyzed in relation to the duration of Doc_1732442_585_595_Chemical treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week).
1732442	4	630	There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group.
1732442	5	934	Myocardial accumulation of [125I]Doc_1732442_967_971_Chemical 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less.
1732442	6	1078	However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05).
1732442	7	1299	In the 5-wk group, Doc_1732442_1318_1322_Chemical accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001).
1732442	8	1446	In the 8-wk group, Doc_1732442_1465_1469_Chemical accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001).
1732442	9	1593	Thus, Doc_1732442_1599_1603_Chemical accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an Doc_1732442_1651_1661_Chemical dose-dependent manner.
1732442	10	1685	The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight Doc_1732442_1773_1794_Disease (scattered or focal Doc_1732442_1815_1836_Disease) indicates that Doc_1732442_1853_1857_Chemical scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of Doc_1732442_1911_1921_Chemical-induced Doc_1732442_1930_1944_Disease.

17344330	1	115	Doc_17344330_127_136_Chemical is prescribed to Doc_17344330_154_160_Chemical addicts to decrease illicit opioid use.
17344330	2	201	Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with Doc_17344330_261_279_Disease (Doc_17344330_281_284_Disease) has been reported in Doc_17344330_307_316_Chemical users.
17344330	3	324	As Doc_17344330_327_333_Chemical addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of Doc_17344330_430_437_Disease to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of Doc_17344330_501_504_Disease in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of Doc_17344330_630_639_Chemical.
17344330	4	641	In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult Doc_17344330_754_760_Chemical addicts treated with Doc_17344330_782_791_Chemical or Doc_17344330_795_808_Chemical on a daily basis.
17344330	5	827	Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included.
17344330	6	944	The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs.
17344330	7	993	All participants were interviewed about any experience of Doc_17344330_1051_1058_Disease.
17344330	8	1060	The association between opioid dose and QT, and Doc_17344330_1108_1117_Chemical dose and reporting of Doc_17344330_1140_1147_Disease was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.
17344330	9	1237	Doc_17344330_1246_1255_Chemical dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002).
17344330	10	1328	No association between Doc_17344330_1351_1364_Chemical and QTc was found.
17344330	11	1384	Among the subjects treated with Doc_17344330_1416_1425_Chemical, 28% men and 32% women had Doc_17344330_1453_1475_Disease.
17344330	12	1477	None of the subjects treated with Doc_17344330_1511_1524_Chemical had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)).
17344330	13	1559	A 50 mg higher Doc_17344330_1574_1583_Chemical dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for Doc_17344330_1657_1664_Disease.
17344330	14	1666	Doc_17344330_1679_1688_Chemical is associated with Doc_17344330_1708_1723_Disease and higher reporting of Doc_17344330_1748_1755_Disease in a population of Doc_17344330_1775_1781_Chemical addicts.

17366349	1	86	Doc_17366349_86_116_Disease (Doc_17366349_118_121_Disease) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic-induced Doc_17366349_181_199_Disease.
17366349	2	201	We describe a case of Doc_17366349_223_253_Disease (Doc_17366349_255_258_Disease) associated with the use of Doc_17366349_287_298_Chemical.
17366349	3	300	Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with Doc_17366349_371_374_Disease, atypical antipsychotic drugs like Doc_17366349_410_421_Chemical may also be a cause.
17366349	4	443	The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of Doc_17366349_495_508_Disease who developed signs and symptoms of Doc_17366349_545_548_Disease after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated Doc_17366349_622_633_Chemical.
17366349	5	635	This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) Doc_17366349_687_690_Disease due to Doc_17366349_698_709_Chemical reported in the literature.

17490790	2	185	To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral Doc_17490790_236_240_Chemical overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, Doc_17490790_363_371_Chemical hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' Doc_17490790_418_422_Chemical staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the Doc_17490790_515_551_Disease and increased Doc_17490790_566_570_Chemical content in the SN of Doc_17490790_592_604_Chemical overloaded animals.
17490790	3	625	The findings showed that peripheral Doc_17490790_661_673_Chemical overload increased the Doc_17490790_697_701_Chemical staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN.
17490790	4	789	As a result, Doc_17490790_802_810_Chemical release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen.
17490790	5	903	Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group.
17490790	6	968	These results suggest that peripheral Doc_17490790_1006_1018_Chemical can increase the Doc_17490790_1036_1040_Chemical level in the SN, where excessive Doc_17490790_1074_1078_Chemical causes the Doc_17490790_1090_1126_Disease.

18808529	3	485	Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that Doc_18808529_732_745_Chemical affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins.
18808529	4	818	We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to Doc_18808529_876_889_Chemical subcutaneous administration.
18808529	5	919	Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
18808529	6	1099	The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin.
18808529	7	1184	Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process.
18808529	8	1400	In conclusion, administration of Doc_18808529_1433_1446_Chemical to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.
18808529	9	1639	These changes, related to Doc_18808529_1665_1681_Disease, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by Doc_18808529_1830_1843_Chemical.

1899352	1	46	A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle.
1899352	2	81	Twenty patients received 27 courses of Doc_1899352_120_130_Chemical administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Doc_1899352_197_202_Chemical.
1899352	3	204	The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of Doc_1899352_282_292_Chemical that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Doc_1899352_378_383_Chemical.
1899352	4	385	Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d.
1899352	5	461	Four patients developed transient microscopic Doc_1899352_507_516_Disease at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d.
1899352	6	547	There were no instances of macroscopic Doc_1899352_586_595_Disease.
1899352	7	597	At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic Doc_1899352_652_660_Disease; Doc_1899352_662_671_Disease (1), Doc_1899352_677_683_Disease (1), and Grade 2 Doc_1899352_701_711_Disease (1).
1899352	8	717	The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion.
1899352	9	889	Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial.
1899352	10	1010	The frequency and predictability of Doc_1899352_1046_1055_Disease are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Doc_1899352_1142_1147_Chemical to the infusate in patients with persistent Doc_1899352_1192_1201_Disease.
1899352	11	1203	The protracted infusion schedule for Doc_1899352_1240_1250_Chemical permits convenient outpatient administration without Doc_1899352_1304_1309_Chemical and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle.
1899352	12	1393	Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.

19105845	3	348	We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of Doc_19105845_433_446_Chemical 120 mg/kg, a known Doc_19105845_466_476_Disease dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of Doc_19105845_526_535_Chemical-induced Doc_19105845_544_555_Disease in the Swiss albino mice.
19105845	4	582	A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to Doc_19105845_686_699_Chemical 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group).
19105845	5	800	Doc_19105845_800_813_Chemical was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min.
19105845	6	969	The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the Doc_19105845_1030_1041_Disease or absence of Doc_19105845_1056_1067_Disease were recorded.
19105845	7	1083	The results showed that IP administration of Doc_19105845_1137_1150_Chemical 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced Doc_19105845_1188_1199_Disease in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.
19105845	8	1257	Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of Doc_19105845_1402_1415_Chemical 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of Doc_19105845_1468_1479_Disease at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.
19105845	9	1543	Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of Doc_19105845_1622_1633_Disease to 99.8% reduction at 240 min.
19105845	10	1665	In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and Doc_19105845_1774_1784_Disease dose of Doc_19105845_1793_1802_Chemical and the risk of Doc_19105845_1819_1830_Disease in a prospective study is novel.

2004015	2	190	We have used a murine model of Doc_2004015_221_225_Disease, Doc_2004015_227_236_Disease of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine Doc_2004015_279_288_Disease (MuLV) virus, to determine if Doc_2004015_319_322_Chemical-induced Doc_2004015_331_338_Disease is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO).
2004015	3	446	Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given Doc_2004015_504_507_Chemical in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml.

2004015	5	620	Despite the Doc_2004015_632_639_Disease, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in Doc_2004015_688_691_Chemical treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment.
2004015	6	807	Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving Doc_2004015_920_923_Chemical for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice.
2004015	7	968	By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals.
2004015	8	1116	The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in Doc_2004015_1158_1161_Chemical treated mice were appropriate for the degree of Doc_2004015_1210_1217_Disease observed when compared with Doc_2004015_1246_1261_Chemical (Doc_2004015_1263_1266_Chemical) treated mice.
2004015	9	1282	The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in Doc_2004015_1379_1382_Chemical and Doc_2004015_1387_1390_Chemical treated mice with similar degrees of Doc_2004015_1428_1435_Disease.

20042557	1	138	To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for Doc_20042557_238_250_Disease repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of Doc_20042557_309_331_Disease.
20042557	2	333	PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative Doc_20042557_498_506_Disease or severe Doc_20042557_517_525_Disease who underwent Doc_20042557_540_552_Disease repair under spinal anesthesia with Doc_20042557_589_597_Chemical sedation.
20042557	3	608	Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation.
20042557	4	817	Doc_20042557_817_839_Disease was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Doc_20042557_904_920_Disease (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery.
20042557	5	1049	From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized.
20042557	6	1145	The prevalence of Doc_20042557_1163_1185_Disease was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of Doc_20042557_1332_1340_Disease will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation.
20042557	7	1411	The mean +/- SD number of days of Doc_20042557_1445_1453_Disease during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+/-1.5 days vs 1.4+/-4.0 days; P=.01).
20042557	8	1590	The use of light Doc_20042557_1619_1627_Chemical sedation decreased the prevalence of Doc_20042557_1665_1687_Disease by 50% compared with deep sedation.
20042557	9	1724	Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing Doc_20042557_1842_1864_Disease in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.
20103708	0	0	The protective role of Nrf2 in Doc_20103708_31_45_Chemical-induced Doc_20103708_54_74_Disease.
20103708	1	76	Doc_20103708_87_107_Disease is one of the major causes of Doc_20103708_138_151_Disease, which is accompanied by the production of reactive Doc_20103708_204_210_Chemical species (ROS).
20103708	2	226	Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.
20103708	3	360	Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against Doc_20103708_437_457_Disease.
20103708	4	459	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against Doc_20103708_535_555_Disease using human kidney biopsy tissues from Doc_20103708_595_615_Disease patients, a Doc_20103708_628_642_Chemical-induced Doc_20103708_651_671_Disease model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells.
20103708	5	733	The glomeruli of human Doc_20103708_765_785_Disease patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels.
20103708	6	853	In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating Doc_20103708_926_940_Chemical-induced Doc_20103708_949_961_Disease.
20103708	7	963	This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and Doc_20103708_1078_1090_Disease compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice.
20103708	8	1121	Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against Doc_20103708_1227_1247_Disease is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.
20103708	9	1389	In human renal mesangial cells, high Doc_20103708_1426_1433_Chemical induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes.
20103708	10	1516	Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production.
20103708	11	1735	This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in Doc_20103708_1805_1825_Disease, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of Doc_20103708_1956_1976_Disease.

20164825	2	267	Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of Doc_20164825_335_345_Chemical Doc_20164825_346_354_Disease.
20164825	3	356	Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive Doc_20164825_422_428_Chemical species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after Doc_20164825_521_531_Chemical administration.
20164825	4	548	Doc_20164825_548_557_Chemical treatment fully blocked Doc_20164825_582_592_Chemical-mediated Doc_20164825_602_621_Disease.
20164825	5	623	This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems.
20164825	6	784	Doc_20164825_784_793_Chemical also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after Doc_20164825_858_868_Chemical administration.
20164825	7	885	These in vivo markers of Doc_20164825_910_928_Disease and their correction by Doc_20164825_953_962_Chemical were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function.
20164825	8	1028	We found that Doc_20164825_1042_1052_Chemical treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores.
20164825	9	1180	These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive Doc_20164825_1234_1240_Chemical species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by Doc_20164825_1315_1324_Chemical.
20164825	10	1326	Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of Doc_20164825_1379_1388_Chemical can lessen Doc_20164825_1400_1410_Chemical Doc_20164825_1411_1425_Disease and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

20195852	9	1744	Among the 15 patients with Doc_20195852_1771_1774_Disease, 6 had cyanotic Doc_20195852_1791_1816_Disease, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243).
20195852	10	1917	Although clinically silent, Doc_20195852_1945_1948_Disease is not rare in pediatrics.

2021202	2	219	Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and Doc_2021202_319_338_Chemical (Doc_2021202_340_343_Chemical) clearance, respectively.
2021202	3	370	Anesthesia was maintained with Doc_2021202_401_409_Chemical, Doc_2021202_411_424_Chemical, Doc_2021202_426_432_Chemical, and Doc_2021202_438_448_Chemical.
2021202	4	450	Doc_2021202_450_461_Disease was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the Doc_2021202_515_525_Chemical inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.
2021202	5	608	GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during Doc_2021202_698_709_Disease.

20394767	1	91	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced Doc_20394767_136_143_Disease paradigm (LES) is suggested to model Doc_20394767_181_188_Disease, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect.
20394767	2	248	In contrast, the fear-potentiated Doc_20394767_282_289_Disease (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear.
20394767	3	336	However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar.
20394767	4	415	The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms.
20394767	5	661	Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist Doc_20394767_746_755_Chemical (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the Doc_20394767_777_781_Chemical(2C) receptor agonist Doc_20394767_803_827_Chemical (Doc_20394767_829_833_Chemical, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the Doc_20394767_856_860_Chemical(A) inverse receptor agonist Doc_20394767_889_907_Chemical (Doc_20394767_909_912_Chemical, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS.
20394767	6	976	None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas Doc_20394767_1025_1029_Chemical increased percentage FPS and Doc_20394767_1059_1068_Chemical increased absolute FPS values.
20394767	7	1100	Furthermore, Doc_20394767_1113_1122_Chemical increased baseline Doc_20394767_1142_1149_Disease amplitude in the LES, while Doc_20394767_1178_1182_Chemical suppressed baseline Doc_20394767_1203_1210_Disease in both the LES and FPS and Doc_20394767_1239_1242_Chemical suppressed baseline Doc_20394767_1263_1270_Disease in the FPS.
20394767	8	1283	In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response.
20394767	9	1401	Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.

20558148	1	130	The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system.
20558148	2	348	Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory Doc_20558148_501_511_Chemical microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility.

20683499	3	485	Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, Doc_20683499_579_586_Chemical (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, Doc_20683499_609_612_Chemical; 5 and 6, Doc_20683499_623_626_Chemical + Doc_20683499_629_636_Chemical (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups.
20683499	4	663	In Doc_20683499_666_685_Disease groups, rats were injected with Doc_20683499_718_721_Chemical-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar Doc_20683499_789_792_Chemical-icv application was repeated.

2334179	4	435	This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients.
2334179	5	532	Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children.

2422478	1	93	Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of Doc_2422478_167_177_Chemical onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 Doc_2422478_217_226_Chemical neurons in the medulla elicits a Doc_2422478_260_271_Disease response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.
2422478	2	339	The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 Doc_2422478_432_441_Chemical neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus.
2422478	3	500	In spontaneously Doc_2422478_517_529_Disease, Doc_2422478_531_537_Disease-prone rats, microinjection of Doc_2422478_568_578_Chemical into the area of the midline B3 Doc_2422478_611_620_Chemical cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent Doc_2422478_671_682_Disease of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the Doc_2422478_769_778_Chemical neurotoxin Doc_2422478_790_813_Chemical (Doc_2422478_815_822_Chemical) injected intracerebroventricularly.
2422478	4	860	However, intraspinal injection of Doc_2422478_894_901_Chemical to produce a more selective lesion of only descending Doc_2422478_956_965_Chemical projections in the spinal cord did not affect this Doc_2422478_1017_1028_Disease.
2422478	5	1030	Further, Doc_2422478_1039_1046_Chemical lesion of Doc_2422478_1057_1066_Chemical nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 Doc_2422478_1164_1173_Chemical cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 Doc_2422478_1252_1261_Chemical Doc_2422478_1262_1272_Chemical injection.
2422478	6	1284	It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a Doc_2422478_1366_1376_Chemical-induced Doc_2422478_1385_1396_Disease via descending projections, the midline Doc_2422478_1437_1446_Chemical B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the Doc_2422478_1489_1500_Disease action of Doc_2422478_1511_1521_Chemical, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

2466960	2	257	We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing Doc_2466960_347_351_Chemical infusion for treatment of solid Doc_2466960_384_390_Disease in order to assess the incidence of Doc_2466960_427_435_Disease ST changes.
2466960	3	448	Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before Doc_2466960_498_502_Chemical infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during Doc_2466960_539_543_Chemical infusion.
2466960	4	554	Doc_2466960_554_561_Disease episodes were rare: only one patient had Doc_2466960_603_609_Disease (during Doc_2466960_618_622_Chemical infusion).
2466960	5	634	However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before Doc_2466960_772_776_Chemical infusion v 17 (68%) during Doc_2466960_804_808_Chemical infusion (P less than .002).
2466960	6	838	The incidence of Doc_2466960_855_863_Disease episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to Doc_2466960_921_925_Chemical infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during Doc_2466960_958_962_Chemical infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before Doc_2466960_1072_1076_Chemical v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during Doc_2466960_1127_1131_Chemical (P less than .01).
2466960	7	1151	ECG changes were more common among patients with known Doc_2466960_1206_1229_Disease.
2466960	8	1231	There were two cases of Doc_2466960_1255_1267_Disease, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course.
2466960	9	1331	We conclude that Doc_2466960_1348_1352_Chemical infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of Doc_2466960_1449_1457_Disease, particularly among patients with Doc_2466960_1492_1515_Disease.

2528969	3	473	Following a 3-week observation period, volunteers were treated with Doc_2528969_541_551_Chemical 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg/day for 9 weeks, followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re-started on 1200 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose at 8-hourly intervals.
2528969	4	770	Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg/day.
2528969	5	887	Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals.
2528969	6	959	Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly Doc_2528969_1034_1040_Disease (64%), Doc_2528969_1048_1055_Disease (55%) and Doc_2528969_1066_1074_Disease (49%).
2528969	7	1082	These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment.
2528969	8	1161	A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy.
2528969	9	1232	This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment.
2528969	10	1316	A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase.
2528969	11	1512	The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg/day.

2533791	0	0	National project on the prevention of mother-to-infant Doc_2533791_55_85_Disease in Japan.
2533791	1	96	In Japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant Doc_2533791_163_193_Disease (HBV) started in 1985.
2533791	2	217	This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both Doc_2533791_333_360_Chemical (Doc_2533791_362_367_Chemical) and Doc_2533791_373_394_Chemical (Doc_2533791_396_401_Chemical) positive mothers.
2533791	3	421	These infants are treated with two injections of Doc_2533791_470_481_Disease immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived Doc_2533791_553_572_Chemical.
2533791	4	574	We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for Doc_2533791_789_794_Chemical, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%.
2533791	5	835	The Doc_2533791_839_844_Chemical positive rate in Doc_2533791_862_867_Chemical positive was 23 to 26%.
2533791	6	892	The Doc_2533791_896_901_Chemical positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively.
2533791	7	990	Some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.
2557556	0	0	Involvement of the mu-opiate receptor in peripheral Doc_2557556_52_61_Disease.

2557556	2	440	Intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of Doc_2557556_556_572_Chemical-induced Doc_2557556_581_593_Disease.
2557556	3	595	The analgesic effect of the mu-agonist Doc_2557556_634_642_Chemical was dose-dependently antagonized by Doc_2557556_679_687_Chemical and prevented by co-injection of pertussis toxin.
2557556	4	738	Doc_2557556_738_746_Chemical did not, however, alter the Doc_2557556_775_787_Disease induced by Doc_2557556_799_837_Chemical.
2557556	5	839	We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the Doc_2557556_1060_1090_Chemical second messenger system.

2564649	1	117	Whereas Doc_2564649_125_142_Disease is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose Doc_2564649_205_213_Chemical anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s).
2564649	2	302	We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with Doc_2564649_456_464_Chemical.
2564649	3	466	Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal Doc_2564649_534_537_Chemical, intravenous administration of Doc_2564649_569_577_Chemical (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles.
2564649	4	730	Such an induced Doc_2564649_746_763_Disease by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, Doc_2564649_938_946_Chemical.
2564649	5	948	Microinjection of Doc_2564649_966_974_Chemical (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation.
2564649	6	1104	It is speculated that the induction of Doc_2564649_1143_1160_Disease by Doc_2564649_1164_1172_Chemical may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.

2569282	2	261	Intense generalized Doc_2569282_281_296_Disease is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists.
2569282	3	354	Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced Doc_2569282_400_408_Disease has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism.
2569282	4	505	In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with Doc_2569282_568_573_Chemical prevents the Doc_2569282_587_602_Disease caused by high-dose Doc_2569282_623_633_Chemical anesthesia in the rat.
2569282	5	657	Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of Doc_2569282_780_792_Chemical), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) Doc_2569282_816_821_Chemical, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) Doc_2569282_844_849_Chemical, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) Doc_2569282_872_877_Chemical [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, Doc_2569282_940_948_Chemical [10 mg/kg]; 5) Doc_2569282_964_969_Chemical [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist Doc_2569282_1034_1041_Chemical [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline.
2569282	6	1069	Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment.
2569282	7	1181	Each rat was then injected with Doc_2569282_1213_1223_Chemical (Doc_2569282_1225_1228_Chemical, 0.5 mg/kg sc).
2569282	8	1245	Doc_2569282_1245_1248_Chemical injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline.
2569282	9	1418	In contrast, Doc_2569282_1431_1436_Chemical prevented Doc_2569282_1447_1457_Chemical-induced Doc_2569282_1466_1481_Disease in a dose-dependent fashion.
2569282	10	1511	The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose Doc_2569282_1558_1563_Chemical group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate.
2569282	11	1668	The high-dose Doc_2569282_1682_1687_Chemical animals were flaccid, Doc_2569282_1710_1718_Disease, and lacked a Doc_2569282_1733_1740_Disease response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2576810	0	0	Some central effects of repeated treatment with Doc_2576810_48_59_Chemical.
2576810	1	61	We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with Doc_2576810_115_126_Chemical, a selective Doc_2576810_140_149_Chemical uptake inhibitor, on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and Doc_2576810_214_225_Chemical and on the animal behavior in the "behavioral despair" test.
2576810	2	287	A repeated treatment with Doc_2576810_313_324_Chemical (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the Doc_2576810_396_407_Chemical-induced Doc_2576810_416_429_Disease.
2576810	3	431	The Doc_2576810_435_448_Disease induced by Doc_2576810_460_471_Chemical in mice remained unaffected by Doc_2576810_503_514_Chemical.
2576810	4	516	The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered Doc_2576810_596_607_Chemical was not affected by repeated treatment with Doc_2576810_652_663_Chemical.
2576810	5	665	Given three times Doc_2576810_683_694_Chemical had no effect on the immobilization time in the "behavioral despair" test in rats.
2576810	6	778	The results indicate that Doc_2576810_804_815_Chemical given repeatedly acts differently than Doc_2576810_855_865_Chemical, another selective Doc_2576810_885_894_Chemical uptake inhibitor, and differs also from other antidepressant drugs.

2594614	1	140	Administration of the local anaesthetic Doc_2594614_180_191_Chemical (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked Doc_2594614_241_307_Disease leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively).
2594614	2	366	Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist Doc_2594614_448_456_Chemical (10 mg/kg), 30 min before Doc_2594614_483_494_Chemical administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the Doc_2594614_545_567_Disease.
2594614	3	569	In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg Doc_2594614_599_607_Chemical given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of Doc_2594614_684_695_Chemical were ineffective.
2594614	4	714	When Doc_2594614_719_727_Chemical (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after Doc_2594614_775_786_Chemical (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the Doc_2594614_825_847_Disease was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective.
2594614	5	908	A partial recovery of Doc_2594614_930_941_Chemical-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with Doc_2594614_1015_1023_Chemical.
2594614	6	1025	Since the administration of Doc_2594614_1053_1061_Chemical, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of Doc_2594614_1198_1206_Chemical, a specific antagonist of PAF, against Doc_2594614_1246_1257_Chemical-induced Doc_2594614_1266_1289_Disease.
2594614	7	1291	Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in Doc_2594614_1373_1384_Chemical-induced Doc_2594614_1393_1419_Disease.
2598570	0	0	The epidemiology of the acute Doc_2598570_30_40_Disease syndrome from Doc_2598570_55_63_Chemical.
2598570	1	65	Doc_2598570_65_73_Chemical, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent.
2598570	2	168	Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute Doc_2598570_218_228_Disease syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States.
2598570	3	327	Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported.
2598570	4	401	To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 Doc_2598570_583_591_Chemical-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome.
2598570	5	648	Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from Doc_2598570_755_764_Disease and Doc_2598570_769_775_Disease (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use Doc_2598570_986_993_Chemical (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5).
2598570	6	1048	Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially Doc_2598570_1143_1152_Chemical), preexisting Doc_2598570_1167_1180_Disease, a history of Doc_2598570_1195_1208_Disease, a history of Doc_2598570_1223_1227_Disease, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt.
2598570	7	1325	These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance.
2598570	8	1423	These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of Doc_2598570_1543_1552_Chemical in renal tubules.

2709684	1	81	Because rats with Doc_2709684_99_113_Chemical-induced Doc_2709684_122_139_Disease (Doc_2709684_141_143_Disease) have a high solute diuresis (Doc_2709684_174_184_Disease of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to Doc_2709684_284_294_Chemical-induced Doc_2709684_303_322_Disease (Doc_2709684_324_327_Disease).
2709684	2	330	The protection from Doc_2709684_350_360_Chemical Doc_2709684_361_375_Disease was studied in non-Doc_2709684_395_403_Disease rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular Doc_2709684_469_476_Chemical reabsorption with Doc_2709684_495_504_Chemical (Doc_2709684_506_507_Chemical).

2709684	4	611	Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days.
2709684	5	713	Group 1 (Doc_2709684_722_723_Chemical alone) received Doc_2709684_740_741_Chemical, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (Doc_2709684_778_779_Chemical + Doc_2709684_782_792_Chemical); Group III (Doc_2709684_806_816_Chemical alone) and Group IV (mild Doc_2709684_843_845_Disease + Doc_2709684_848_858_Chemical).
2709684	6	861	Doc_2709684_861_872_Disease doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of Doc_2709684_905_915_Chemical were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV.
2709684	7	1000	In Group I, Doc_2709684_1012_1013_Chemical induced a moderate and stable Doc_2709684_1044_1054_Disease (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of Doc_2709684_1125_1142_Disease (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (Doc_2709684_1214_1230_Disease score [maximum 4], zero).
2709684	8	1257	In Group II, Doc_2709684_1270_1271_Chemical did not prevent Doc_2709684_1288_1298_Chemical-Doc_2709684_1299_1302_Disease (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, Doc_2709684_1342_1343_Chemical less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and Doc_2709684_1412_1428_Disease score, 3.9 +/- 0.1).
2709684	9	1450	These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (Doc_2709684_1536_1537_Chemical less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; Doc_2709684_1598_1614_Disease score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

2716967	1	128	Previous studies demonstrated that both Doc_2716967_168_176_Chemical and Doc_2716967_181_189_Chemical induced Doc_2716967_198_207_Disease and Doc_2716967_212_221_Disease in the rat.
2716967	2	234	Pre-treatment with Doc_2716967_253_261_Chemical produced cross-tolerance to Doc_2716967_290_298_Chemical, whereas pretreatment with Doc_2716967_326_334_Chemical did not induce cross-tolerance to Doc_2716967_369_377_Chemical but rather augmented the Doc_2716967_403_413_Disease response; this augmentation was attributed to residual Doc_2716967_469_477_Chemical in the brain.
2716967	3	492	The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of Doc_2716967_599_607_Chemical and Doc_2716967_612_620_Chemical, administered simultaneously.
2716967	4	651	There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of Doc_2716967_712_720_Chemical and Doc_2716967_725_733_Chemical, but sub-effective doses of Doc_2716967_762_770_Chemical partly antagonized fully-effective doses of Doc_2716967_815_823_Chemical.
2716967	5	825	Latency to the loss of righting reflex, Doc_2716967_865_873_Disease and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of Doc_2716967_939_947_Chemical or Doc_2716967_951_959_Chemical in each combination.
2716967	6	981	Doc_2716967_981_989_Chemical inhibited the induced Doc_2716967_1012_1022_Disease effects.

2716967	8	1185	Rats, tolerant to Doc_2716967_1203_1211_Chemical-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to Doc_2716967_1294_1302_Chemical-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to Doc_2716967_1348_1356_Chemical but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to Doc_2716967_1422_1430_Chemical.
2716967	9	1432	While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced Doc_2716967_1530_1539_Disease, differences in latency, Doc_2716967_1565_1573_Disease and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for Doc_2716967_1649_1657_Chemical would argue against an action at a single opioid site.

2826064	4	569	In the 7-hour period after Doc_2826064_596_607_Chemical administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma Doc_2826064_678_687_Chemical levels and drug concentrations.
2826064	5	720	The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between Doc_2826064_794_805_Chemical concentrations and Doc_2826064_825_834_Chemical effects.
2826064	6	844	Doc_2826064_844_854_Chemical caused decreases of 65% and 56% of Doc_2826064_890_901_Chemical volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC.
2826064	7	990	In spite of higher Doc_2826064_1009_1020_Chemical concentrations after Doc_2826064_1042_1052_Chemical pretreatment, the Doc_2826064_1071_1082_Disease was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.

2840807	1	94	The Doc_2840807_98_115_Disease investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic Doc_2840807_196_204_Disease, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit.
2840807	2	286	The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE-mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway.
2840807	3	490	However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the Doc_2840807_580_584_Chemical N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term Doc_2840807_788_798_Disease at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the Doc_2840807_900_917_Disease; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder.
2840807	4	1207	These questions are currently being investigated.
2886572	0	0	Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in Doc_2886572_55_66_Chemical-induced Doc_2886572_75_87_Disease rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.
2886572	1	156	The present study examines the effect of 6-day Doc_2886572_203_214_Chemical treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and Doc_2886572_371_382_Chemical-treated rats.
2886572	2	397	Renal Doc_2886572_403_416_Chemical stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of Doc_2886572_496_510_Chemical only.
2886572	3	517	However, Doc_2886572_526_537_Chemical treatment resulted in the incorporation of Doc_2886572_581_592_Chemical into renal Doc_2886572_604_617_Chemical stores such that approximately 40% of the Doc_2886572_660_673_Chemical present was Doc_2886572_686_697_Chemical while the Doc_2886572_708_722_Chemical content was reduced by a similar degree.
2886572	4	764	Total tissue Doc_2886572_777_790_Chemical content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged.
2886572	5	845	Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the Doc_2886572_911_922_Chemical-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both Doc_2886572_992_1006_Chemical and Doc_2886572_1011_1022_Chemical in proportions similar to those found in the kidney.
2886572	6	1076	This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade.
2886572	7	1194	Doc_2886572_1194_1205_Chemical had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group.
2886572	8	1266	Doc_2886572_1266_1278_Chemical increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the Doc_2886572_1384_1395_Chemical-treated group.
2886572	9	1411	In conclusion, chronic Doc_2886572_1434_1445_Chemical treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow.
2886572	10	1514	However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration.
2886572	11	1699	Furthermore, data obtained with Doc_2886572_1731_1743_Chemical alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after Doc_2886572_1861_1872_Chemical treatment.

Doc_2893236_312_322_Chemical produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased Doc_2893236_388_392_Chemical, decreased Doc_2893236_404_413_Chemical, and had no effect on Doc_2893236_436_445_Chemical or Doc_2893236_449_456_Chemical levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem.
2893236	3	515	Pretreatment of rats with Doc_2893236_541_558_Chemical for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of Doc_2893236_654_664_Chemical. 50 mg/kg, i.v. Doc_2893236_681_691_Chemical produced Doc_2893236_701_719_Disease with further increase in Doc_2893236_745_749_Chemical and decrease in Doc_2893236_766_775_Chemical again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the Doc_2893236_836_847_Chemical studied in four regions of rat brain.

28952	1	163	To investigate the initial Doc_28952_190_199_Chemical loss and development of Doc_28952_224_236_Disease during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential Doc_28952_356_368_Disease who had shown Doc_28952_383_395_Disease under prior oral diuretic treatment.
28952	2	433	Doc_28952_433_447_Chemical (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days.
28952	3	485	Six patients received a normal-Doc_28952_516_522_Chemical diet and four a low-Doc_28952_543_549_Chemical (17 mmol/day) diet.
28952	4	570	All patients had a normal initial total body Doc_28952_615_624_Chemical (40K).
28952	5	632	The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and Doc_28952_708_719_Chemical secretion rate were measured.
28952	6	750	In both groups a Doc_28952_767_776_Chemical deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment.
28952	7	894	In the normal-Doc_28952_908_914_Chemical group the highest mean Doc_28952_938_947_Chemical deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some Doc_28952_996_1005_Chemical was regained; in the low-Doc_28952_1031_1037_Chemical group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13.
28952	8	1088	The normal-Doc_28952_1099_1105_Chemical group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and Doc_28952_1168_1179_Chemical levels; in the low-Doc_28952_1199_1205_Chemical group renin and Doc_28952_1222_1233_Chemical increased more slowly but remained elevated.
28952	9	1279	It is concluded that dietary Doc_28952_1308_1314_Chemical restriction increases diuretic-induced Doc_28952_1354_1363_Chemical loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-Doc_28952_1419_1430_Chemical-Doc_28952_1431_1442_Chemical system, while Doc_28952_1457_1463_Chemical delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased Doc_28952_1546_1555_Chemical secretion.

3088349	2	319	In order to clarify the nature of this initial Doc_3088349_366_388_Disease we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on Doc_3088349_468_479_Chemical-induced Doc_3088349_488_507_Disease.
3088349	3	509	Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion.
3088349	4	596	Such Doc_3088349_601_623_Disease may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons.
3088349	5	759	A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when Doc_3088349_831_842_Chemical was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the Doc_3088349_950_972_Disease.
3088349	6	974	However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, Doc_3088349_1065_1076_Chemical dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), Doc_3088349_1115_1126_Chemical-induced Doc_3088349_1135_1143_Disease tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further Doc_3088349_1299_1310_Chemical injections.
3088349	7	1323	These findings suggest that Doc_3088349_1351_1362_Chemical has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to Doc_3088349_1433_1455_Disease.

3115150	2	284	Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, Doc_3115150_375_383_Disease was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity.
3115150	3	455	Intraperitoneal Doc_3115150_471_481_Chemical administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the Doc_3115150_542_552_Chemical-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline.
3115150	4	646	Doc_3115150_646_662_Chemical at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the Doc_3115150_725_733_Disease produced by Doc_3115150_746_756_Chemical.
3115150	5	758	Despite the absence of Doc_3115150_781_789_Disease, animals that received Doc_3115150_813_823_Chemical (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by Doc_3115150_867_877_Chemical were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving Doc_3115150_972_982_Chemical alone.
3115150	6	990	Rats that received Doc_3115150_1009_1019_Chemical and Doc_3115150_1024_1034_Chemical exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received Doc_3115150_1156_1166_Chemical alone.
3115150	7	1174	These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that Doc_3115150_1237_1252_Disease, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways.

3131282	2	270	Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% Doc_3131282_346_349_Chemical by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with Doc_3131282_415_417_Chemical at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks.
3131282	3	464	In groups given 2% Doc_3131282_483_486_Chemical, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% Doc_3131282_612_614_Chemical significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of Doc_3131282_675_693_Disease (Doc_3131282_695_718_Disease and Doc_3131282_723_732_Disease) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with Doc_3131282_760_769_Disease) from 15% (3/20, one rat with Doc_3131282_800_809_Disease) in the group given Doc_3131282_830_832_Chemical-free water.

3137399	2	214	Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known.
3137399	3	295	We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects.
3137399	4	377	Forty-four Doc_3137399_388_391_Chemical-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated.
3137399	5	454	All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations.
3137399	6	632	The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level.
3137399	7	686	One of the patients developed Doc_3137399_716_731_Disease after 30 mg m-2 Doc_3137399_748_751_Chemical and only 150 mg m-2 Doc_3137399_772_783_Chemical.
3137399	8	785	The Doc_3137399_789_804_Disease was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test.
3137399	9	874	None of the other patients developed clinical Doc_3137399_920_934_Disease, nor did the studied parameters change.
3137399	10	975	The literature on this subject was also reviewed.
3137399	11	1025	Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that Doc_3137399_1111_1114_Chemical-related Doc_3137399_1123_1137_Disease is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with Doc_3137399_1283_1294_Chemical.

3220106	1	98	Rats were pretreated with saline or Doc_3220106_134_142_Chemical (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or Doc_3220106_274_282_Chemical for 1, 5 and 14 days.
3220106	2	305	At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected Doc_3220106_428_436_Chemical (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]Doc_3220106_495_503_Chemical and [3H]Doc_3220106_512_521_Chemical binding sites in the striatum.

3220106	4	717	In rats which were pretreated with Doc_3220106_752_760_Chemical for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the Doc_3220106_813_821_Chemical-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]Doc_3220106_913_921_Chemical binding sites and also with an elevated Doc_3220106_962_970_Chemical (Doc_3220106_972_974_Chemical) level in the striatum.
3220106	5	999	The number of striatal [3H]Doc_3220106_1026_1035_Chemical binding sites was not affected.
3220106	6	1068	In animals pretreated with Doc_3220106_1095_1103_Chemical for 14 days, the Doc_3220106_1121_1129_Chemical-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated.
3220106	7	1185	However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]Doc_3220106_1263_1272_Chemical binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]Doc_3220106_1325_1333_Chemical binding sites and the striatal Doc_3220106_1365_1367_Chemical level were normal.
3220106	8	1387	These results suggest that chronic Doc_3220106_1422_1430_Chemical-treated rats develop Doc_3220106_1452_1475_Disease in response to Doc_3220106_1491_1499_Chemical initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and Doc_3220106_1574_1576_Chemical concentration, followed by inducing Doc_3220106_1613_1615_Chemical receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.

3311455	5	728	Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic Doc_3311455_783_797_Disease secondary to long-term therapy with Doc_3311455_834_846_Chemical.
3311455	6	848	Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum Doc_3311455_939_949_Chemical.
3311455	7	951	We think that even these lower dosages of Doc_3311455_993_1005_Chemical can cause chronic Doc_3311455_1024_1038_Disease and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.

3411101	3	293	After delivery, the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.
3411101	4	365	The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation.
3411101	5	438	Doc_3411101_438_447_Chemical itself or Doc_3411101_458_480_Chemical may be responsible for fulminant Doc_3411101_514_523_Disease in this patient.

3413271	1	101	The role of Doc_3413271_113_124_Chemical in eliciting Doc_3413271_138_157_Disease was examined in patients with Doc_3413271_188_211_Disease.
3413271	2	213	Objective signs of Doc_3413271_232_240_Disease and factors increasing myocardial Doc_3413271_275_281_Chemical consumption were compared during Doc_3413271_315_326_Chemical infusion and supine bicycle exercise.
3413271	3	365	Both Doc_3413271_370_381_Chemical and exercise produced Doc_3413271_404_423_Disease as evidenced by ST segment Doc_3413271_451_461_Disease and Doc_3413271_466_472_Disease.
3413271	4	474	However, the mechanisms of Doc_3413271_501_520_Disease induced by Doc_3413271_532_543_Chemical were significantly different from those of exercise.
3413271	5	597	Exercise-induced Doc_3413271_614_633_Disease was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while Doc_3413271_766_777_Chemical-induced Doc_3413271_786_794_Disease was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product.
3413271	6	923	These findings indicate that Doc_3413271_952_960_Disease produced by Doc_3413271_973_984_Chemical, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.
3431591	0	0	Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor Doc_3431591_80_115_Chemical (Doc_3431591_117_124_Chemical).
3431591	1	127	Doc_3431591_127_134_Chemical, Doc_3431591_136_171_Chemical, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose Doc_3431591_237_249_Disease is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme.
3431591	2	308	Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of Doc_3431591_382_389_Chemical polyglutamates.
3431591	3	406	Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]Doc_3431591_467_474_Chemical, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as Doc_3431591_539_546_Chemical tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses.
3431591	4	644	As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than Doc_3431591_774_781_Chemical, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of Doc_3431591_864_871_Chemical Doc_3431591_872_884_Disease.
3431591	5	886	In early clinical studies with Doc_3431591_917_924_Chemical, activity has been seen in Doc_3431591_952_965_Disease, Doc_3431591_967_981_Disease, Doc_3431591_983_991_Disease, and Doc_3431591_997_1009_Disease.
3431591	6	1011	Doc_3431591_1011_1021_Disease included Doc_3431591_1031_1045_Disease, Doc_3431591_1047_1054_Disease, and dose-limiting Doc_3431591_1074_1088_Disease.
3431591	7	1090	This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of Doc_3431591_1214_1221_Chemical under acidic conditions.
3431591	8	1247	In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of Doc_3431591_1307_1314_Chemical administered with alkaline diuresis is under way.
3431591	9	1365	Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in Doc_3431591_1434_1448_Disease may have been achieved with only 1 instance of Doc_3431591_1496_1510_Disease in 10 patients.
3431591	10	1527	Doc_3431591_1527_1541_Disease and Doc_3431591_1546_1553_Disease are again the most frequent side effects.
3431591	11	1596	Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients.
3431591	12	1656	Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter Doc_3431591_1736_1743_Chemical plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.

343678	1	91	Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study.
343678	2	154	Doc_343678_154_165_Disease immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing Doc_343678_321_337_Disease after needle-stick exposure to Doc_343678_369_396_Chemical (Doc_343678_398_403_Chemical)-positive donors.
343678	3	422	Clinical Doc_343678_431_440_Disease developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001).
343678	4	609	Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients.
343678	5	699	Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (Doc_343678_788_793_Chemical; anti-HBE).
343678	6	806	Both DNAP and Doc_343678_820_825_Chemical showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of Doc_343678_904_909_Chemical-positive donors.
343678	7	927	Doc_343678_927_938_Disease immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing Doc_343678_1008_1024_Disease even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups.
343678	8	1095	The efficacy of ISG in preventing Doc_343678_1129_1145_Disease cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.
3461217	0	0	Production of autochthonous Doc_3461217_28_43_Disease in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with Doc_3461217_85_107_Chemical and Doc_3461217_112_124_Chemical.
3461217	1	126	More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable Doc_3461217_201_225_Disease (Doc_3461217_227_230_Disease) following treatments with Doc_3461217_258_280_Chemical (CAS: 684-93-5) and Doc_3461217_301_324_Chemical [(Doc_3461217_327_329_Chemical) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the Doc_3461217_362_367_Disease-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions.
3461217	2	412	The incubation periods averaged 10.6 months.
3461217	3	457	Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable Doc_3461217_524_526_Disease when treated only with Doc_3461217_550_552_Chemical.
3461217	4	554	In L-W rats, Doc_3461217_567_569_Chemical acted as a Doc_3461217_581_586_Disease enhancement agent, with primary emphasis on the development of Doc_3461217_650_665_Disease.
3535719	0	0	Relative efficacy and Doc_3535719_22_30_Disease of Doc_3535719_34_44_Chemical and Doc_3535719_49_59_Chemical in oncology patients.
3535719	1	82	We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of Doc_3535719_135_153_Chemical or Doc_3535719_157_175_Chemical in conjunction with Doc_3535719_196_215_Chemical in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe Doc_3535719_271_281_Disease.
3535719	2	283	The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious.
3535719	3	336	Doc_3535719_336_350_Disease occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with Doc_3535719_409_419_Chemical and Doc_3535719_424_434_Chemical (17% vs 11%).
3535719	4	449	Doc_3535719_449_460_Disease occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 Doc_3535719_491_501_Chemical and Doc_3535719_506_518_Chemical and in 12 (22%) of 54 Doc_3535719_541_551_Chemical and Doc_3535719_556_568_Chemical-treated patients.
3535719	5	587	Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four Doc_3535719_649_659_Chemical and Doc_3535719_664_676_Chemical-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine Doc_3535719_763_773_Chemical and Doc_3535719_778_790_Chemical-treated patients.
3535719	6	809	The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in Doc_3535719_1003_1013_Chemical and Doc_3535719_1018_1030_Chemical- vs Doc_3535719_1035_1045_Chemical and Doc_3535719_1050_1062_Chemical-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115).
3535719	7	1105	We conclude that Doc_3535719_1122_1136_Chemical-associated Doc_3535719_1148_1159_Disease was less severe and more often reversible with Doc_3535719_1207_1217_Chemical than with Doc_3535719_1228_1238_Chemical.

3653576	1	97	Doc_3653576_97_138_Disease to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of Doc_3653576_244_268_Chemical (Doc_3653576_270_274_Chemical), Doc_3653576_277_302_Chemical (Doc_3653576_304_307_Chemical), and Doc_3653576_314_331_Chemical (Doc_3653576_333_336_Chemical), respectively.
3653576	2	353	Several routine indicators of Doc_3653576_383_397_Disease, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of Doc_3653576_495_512_Disease were determined on urine samples.
3653576	3	547	Tubular damage produced by Doc_3653576_574_578_Chemical or Doc_3653576_582_585_Chemical was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from Doc_3653576_647_664_Disease produced by Doc_3653576_677_680_Chemical.
3653576	4	682	The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in Doc_3653576_739_756_Disease, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 Da.
3653576	5	824	In contrast, Doc_3653576_837_854_Disease in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by Doc_3653576_919_940_Disease of a wide range of molecular weights.
3653576	6	979	Proximal tubular damage caused by Doc_3653576_1013_1017_Chemical and papillary damage caused by Doc_3653576_1049_1052_Chemical were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis (volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes.
3653576	7	1181	Alkaline phosphatase and Doc_3653576_1206_1213_Chemical were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage.
3653576	8	1364	It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of Doc_3653576_1542_1554_Disease.
3670965	0	0	A catch in the Doc_3670965_15_19_Disease.
3670965	1	21	Twenty-six cases of Doc_3670965_41_54_Disease from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed.
3670965	2	155	Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Doc_3670965_265_278_Disease.
3670965	3	280	Doc_3670965_280_287_Chemical or Doc_3670965_291_301_Chemical ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and Doc_3670965_363_374_Chemical (Doc_3670965_376_389_Chemical) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%).
3670965	4	445	Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Doc_3670965_489_502_Disease was accomplished in 90% of the cases.
3670965	5	541	The incidence of Doc_3670965_558_571_Disease in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain.
3670965	6	823	The mortality for these Doc_3670965_847_860_Disease cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States.
3670965	7	952	In Australia, the pediatric usage of Doc_3670965_989_996_Chemical has been extremely low for the past 25 years (less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with Doc_3670965_1090_1101_Chemical (Doc_3670965_1103_1116_Chemical) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market.
3670965	8	1177	Doc_3670965_1177_1190_Disease may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with Doc_3670965_1267_1278_Chemical or Doc_3670965_1282_1289_Chemical ingestion, since there were no cases found at The Children's Hospital in 1983, 1984, or 1985.

3686155	1	47	Two multigravida patients with no prior Doc_3686155_87_98_Disease history were seen with postpartum Doc_3686155_133_142_Disease, having received Doc_3686155_160_173_Chemical for Doc_3686155_178_201_Disease.
3686155	2	203	Doc_3686155_203_216_Chemical given in high doses has been associated with Doc_3686155_262_271_Disease in patients receiving the drug for Doc_3686155_307_326_Disease.
3686155	3	328	These cases demonstrate that Doc_3686155_357_370_Chemical may cause Doc_3686155_381_390_Disease even when given in low doses.

3703509	1	64	This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long-standing Doc_3703509_157_178_Disease.
3703509	2	180	Following short exposure to oral Doc_3703509_213_223_Chemical, both boys developed Doc_3703509_245_253_Disease, increasing Doc_3703509_266_276_Disease, Doc_3703509_278_288_Disease, Doc_3703509_290_300_Disease, and Doc_3703509_306_314_Disease.
3703509	3	316	Both presented in the emergency room with profound Doc_3703509_367_371_Disease, Doc_3703509_373_384_Disease, severe Doc_3703509_393_406_Disease, and Doc_3703509_412_420_Disease.
3703509	4	422	Nonketotic Doc_3703509_433_448_Disease was present in one and Doc_3703509_472_479_Disease without a known serum Doc_3703509_502_509_Chemical level was present in the other.
3703509	5	542	Doc_3703509_542_561_Disease rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation.
3703509	6	641	We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic Doc_3703509_713_740_Disease in the Doc_3703509_748_769_Disease.
3708922	0	0	Experimental Doc_3708922_13_25_Chemical Doc_3708922_26_40_Disease: risk of concomitant chemotherapy.
3708922	1	76	The role of Doc_3708922_88_100_Chemical (Doc_3708922_102_105_Chemical) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of Doc_3708922_184_198_Disease was evaluated in rats.
3708922	2	222	Administration of 20 mg/kg/day Doc_3708922_253_256_Chemical for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man.
3708922	3	350	The combined administration of Doc_3708922_381_384_Chemical and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a Doc_3708922_427_438_Disease potential, such as Doc_3708922_458_468_Chemical (at therapeutic doses), Doc_3708922_493_508_Chemical and Doc_3708922_513_525_Chemical, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the Doc_3708922_605_608_Chemical induced Doc_3708922_617_625_Disease in the rat model.
3708922	4	644	Doc_3708922_644_654_Chemical at toxic doses, however, increased Doc_3708922_690_693_Chemical Doc_3708922_694_708_Disease.
3708922	5	710	Thus, the Doc_3708922_720_734_Disease induced by Doc_3708922_746_749_Chemical has a different pathogenetic mechanism.

3732088	1	71	It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma Doc_3732088_122_131_Chemical can alter the tendency towards Doc_3732088_163_182_Disease.
3732088	2	184	If this were so, patients with Doc_3732088_215_238_Disease might be especially susceptible.
3732088	3	272	Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential Doc_3732088_358_370_Disease and known Doc_3732088_381_404_Disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a Doc_3732088_439_448_Chemical-conserving diuretic (Doc_3732088_470_479_Chemical) and a similar period on a Doc_3732088_507_516_Chemical-losing diuretic (Doc_3732088_534_548_Chemical) in a randomised study.
3732088	4	573	Plasma Doc_3732088_580_589_Chemical concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the Doc_3732088_647_661_Chemical phase compared to Doc_3732088_680_689_Chemical therapy.
3732088	5	699	Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and Doc_3732088_776_789_Chemical (Doc_3732088_791_805_Chemical) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens.
3732088	6	854	Compared to Doc_3732088_866_875_Chemical treatment, the Doc_3732088_891_905_Chemical phase was associated with an increased frequency of Doc_3732088_958_983_Disease (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.
3732088	7	1237	The above results indicate that because Doc_3732088_1277_1286_Chemical-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with Doc_3732088_1376_1399_Disease, even minor falls in plasma Doc_3732088_1428_1437_Chemical concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

7066357	1	137	This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in Doc_7066357_232_250_Disease induced by Doc_7066357_262_287_Chemical were due to Doc_7066357_300_318_Disease per se, or, at least in part, to the Doc_7066357_356_371_Chemical.
7066357	2	373	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of Doc_7066357_501_526_Chemical (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of Doc_7066357_583_601_Disease.
7066357	3	603	Since massive Doc_7066357_617_628_Disease occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-Doc_7066357_720_729_Disease stage (day 1-5) and Doc_7066357_750_759_Disease stage (day 6-11).
7066357	4	778	In pre-Doc_7066357_785_794_Disease stage the plasma level of Doc_7066357_821_832_Chemical, Doc_7066357_834_849_Chemical and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, Doc_7066357_897_915_Chemical and HDL remained constant.
7066357	5	943	Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5).
7066357	6	1013	At the beginning of Doc_7066357_1033_1042_Disease stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days.
7066357	7	1261	The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern.
7066357	8	1320	Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9).
7066357	9	1376	Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml).
7066357	10	1501	In the pre-Doc_7066357_1512_1521_Disease stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early Doc_7066357_1579_1588_Disease stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL.
7066357	11	1660	These observations indicate that Doc_7066357_1693_1718_Chemical alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL.
7066357	12	1783	It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in Doc_7066357_1856_1865_Disease rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.

7161250	1	116	The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with Doc_7161250_209_220_Chemical.
7161250	2	222	The incidence of Doc_7161250_239_251_Disease was higher at higher doses of Doc_7161250_282_293_Chemical and in younger patients.
7161250	3	319	Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients.
7161250	4	412	However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after Doc_7161250_507_519_Disease developed.
7161250	5	531	Doc_7161250_531_540_Disease was controlled by the Doc_7161250_563_577_Chemical Doc_7161250_578_587_Chemical in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective.
7161250	6	669	The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to Doc_7161250_782_793_Chemical.
7189975	0	0	Deaths from local anesthetic-induced Doc_7189975_37_48_Disease in mice.
7189975	1	58	Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic-induced Doc_7189975_245_256_Disease.
7189975	2	258	The CD50 and LD50, respectively, were 57.7 and 58.7 mg/kg for Doc_7189975_320_331_Chemical, 111.0 and 133.1 mg/kg for Doc_7189975_359_368_Chemical, and 243.4 and 266.5 mg/kg for Doc_7189975_400_414_Chemical.
7189975	3	416	When given intraperitoneally, Doc_7189975_446_457_Chemical thus was only about twice as toxic as Doc_7189975_496_505_Chemical and four times as toxic as Doc_7189975_533_547_Chemical.
7189975	4	549	Doc_7189975_549_560_Disease always preceded death, except after precipitous Doc_7189975_609_631_Disease from extreme doses.
7189975	5	652	A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing Doc_7189975_693_704_Disease in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of Doc_7189975_741_752_Chemical-induced Doc_7189975_761_769_Disease, in 57% of the Doc_7189975_785_799_Chemical group, and in 6% of the Doc_7189975_824_833_Chemical group.
7189975	6	841	The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated Doc_7189975_938_949_Disease present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated.

7282516	2	299	We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving Doc_7282516_494_497_Chemical.
7282516	3	499	Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative Doc_7282516_576_579_Chemical dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2.
7282516	4	612	Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a "threshold" for expression.
7282516	5	743	Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration.

7437994	4	368	These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to Doc_7437994_471_478_Chemical, available for most of our patients.
7437994	5	516	No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during Doc_7437994_588_595_Chemical treatment.
7437994	6	607	Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-Doc_7437994_704_711_Chemical values.
7437994	7	720	Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients.

7596955	7	1109	All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required.
7596955	8	1253	Intraplatelet Doc_7596955_1267_1271_Chemical content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol).
7596955	9	1433	The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted.
7596955	10	1606	In conclusion, the combined administration of Doc_7596955_1652_1655_Chemical/Doc_7596955_1656_1659_Chemical is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.

7604176	4	324	He assumed Doc_7604176_335_346_Chemical (20 mg/day) because of Doc_7604176_370_390_Disease.
7604176	5	392	He was admitted with acute Doc_7604176_419_427_Disease of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after Doc_7604176_482_493_Chemical discontinuation.
7604176	6	511	A previously unknown Doc_7604176_532_546_Disease, probably due to chronic Doc_7604176_572_594_Disease, was evidenced.

761833	1	65	Doc_761833_65_72_Chemical Doc_761833_73_77_Disease was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol Doc_761833_166_171_Chemical.
761833	2	173	This Doc_761833_178_182_Disease was prevented with 1.68 mmol Doc_761833_212_218_Chemical given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the Doc_761833_269_282_Chemical injection.
761833	3	294	The effect of Doc_761833_308_314_Chemical was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain Doc_761833_365_372_Chemical, an increase in brain Doc_761833_395_403_Chemical, and an increase in renal excretion of Doc_761833_443_450_Chemical and Doc_761833_455_459_Chemical.
761833	4	461	Intraventricular infusion of Doc_761833_490_498_Chemical sufficient to raise the brain Doc_761833_529_537_Chemical to the same extent did not prevent the Doc_761833_577_584_Chemical Doc_761833_585_589_Disease nor affect the blood and brain Doc_761833_621_628_Chemical concentrations.

7647582	6	852	Doc_7647582_852_861_Chemical administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver.
7647582	7	1023	In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats.
7647582	8	1159	This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which Doc_7647582_1228_1237_Chemical and/or Doc_7647582_1245_1255_Chemical could produce a Doc_7647582_1272_1288_Disease condition similar to that of Doc_7647582_1318_1327_Chemical Doc_7647582_1328_1337_Disease either alone or subsequent to Doc_7647582_1368_1377_Chemical administration.

7724492	1	85	Acute Doc_7724492_91_102_Chemical-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) Doc_7724492_130_144_Disease was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental Doc_7724492_205_223_Disease.
7724492	2	225	In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free Doc_7724492_261_272_Chemical (Doc_7724492_274_276_Chemical) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived.
7724492	3	393	A 3 times higher Doc_7724492_410_421_Disease appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with Doc_7724492_487_489_Chemical.
7724492	4	491	Free NP did not provoke any Doc_7724492_519_530_Disease.
7724492	5	532	Two hr post-injection, DXNP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free Doc_7724492_613_615_Chemical (p < 0.025).
7724492	6	629	In rats with immune experimental Doc_7724492_662_680_Disease, 5/6 rats given Doc_7724492_697_699_Chemical died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived.
7724492	7	798	Doc_7724492_798_809_Disease appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after Doc_7724492_897_908_Chemical treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and Doc_7724492_985_987_Chemical.
7724492	8	989	Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls.
7724492	9	1038	These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free Doc_7724492_1139_1141_Chemical, despite of an enhanced Doc_7724492_1166_1180_Disease of the former.
7724492	10	1196	Both effects (better survival and Doc_7724492_1230_1239_Disease) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.

7752389	1	102	In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled Doc_7752389_191_212_Chemical facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure.
7752389	2	280	The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist Doc_7752389_352_361_Chemical and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist Doc_7752389_404_413_Chemical, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors.
7752389	3	517	Intra-arterially given Doc_7752389_540_544_Chemical produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the Doc_7752389_654_656_Chemical had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle.
7752389	4	720	The effect of intra-arterial Doc_7752389_749_753_Chemical could not be blocked by intra-arterial Doc_7752389_793_802_Chemical or Doc_7752389_806_815_Chemical, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial Doc_7752389_900_904_Chemical was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the Doc_7752389_971_973_Chemical was given intravesically.
7752389	5	1000	The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial Doc_7752389_1053_1057_Chemical, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor.
7752389	6	1193	However, when given intravesically, Doc_7752389_1229_1233_Chemical may stimulate micturition by releasing Doc_7752389_1273_1284_Chemical from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium.
7752389	7	1341	These Doc_7752389_1347_1358_Chemical, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors.
7752389	8	1437	Doc_7752389_1437_1448_Chemical may, via release of Doc_7752389_1469_1480_Chemical, contribute to both urge and Doc_7752389_1510_1531_Disease seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.

7803371	2	249	Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability.
7803371	3	370	Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature.
7803371	4	472	The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from Doc_7803371_546_552_Disease, Doc_7803371_554_566_Disease, Doc_7803371_568_576_Disease, Doc_7803371_578_584_Disease, slurred speech and Doc_7803371_605_614_Disease to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and Doc_7803371_688_707_Disease (Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989).
7803371	5	871	There have also been two reported fatalities from Doc_7803371_921_923_Chemical overdoses (Fleming 1986).

783197	2	190	The effects of Doc_783197_205_225_Chemical on myocardial Doc_783197_240_246_Chemical supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive Doc_783197_323_346_Disease, but have not been measured previously in man.
783197	3	394	We assessed the effects of Doc_783197_421_428_Chemical (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic Doc_783197_543_566_Disease without clinical Doc_783197_584_608_Disease.
783197	4	610	Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that Doc_783197_779_786_Chemical administration was omitted.
783197	5	815	Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given Doc_783197_924_931_Chemical, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients.
783197	6	996	Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after Doc_783197_1215_1222_Chemical infusion was completed.

783197	8	1438	No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients.
783197	9	1514	No significant change in myocardial Doc_783197_1550_1556_Chemical consumption occurred after Doc_783197_1584_1591_Chemical administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the Doc_783197_1686_1693_Chemical patients than in the control patients.
783197	10	1733	We conclude that in patients with chronic Doc_783197_1775_1798_Disease who are not in clinical Doc_783197_1823_1847_Disease Doc_783197_1848_1891_Disease after Doc_783197_1898_1905_Chemical administration even when it is initially normal.
783197	11	1955	Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial Doc_783197_2055_2061_Chemical consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial Doc_783197_2153_2159_Chemical consumption.

7843916	2	282	The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes.
7843916	3	443	The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system.
7843916	4	594	Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M Doc_7843916_665_678_Chemical for 12 days.
7843916	5	692	Intraocular pressure was monitored daily.
7843916	6	734	After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy.
7843916	7	904	A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with Doc_7843916_1014_1027_Chemical with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of Doc_7843916_1097_1110_Chemical exposure.
7843916	8	1121	The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive Doc_7843916_1175_1188_Chemical, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period.
7843916	9	1255	The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal.

7843916	11	1692	The Doc_7843916_1696_1709_Chemical-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle Doc_7843916_1822_1835_Chemical-induced morphologic changes were evident.
7843916	12	1878	Doc_7843916_1890_1903_Chemical treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of Doc_7843916_1982_2001_Disease in approximately 30% of the Doc_7843916_2030_2043_Chemical-treated eyes.
7843916	13	2058	Doc_7843916_2058_2065_Chemical treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for Doc_7843916_2165_2188_Disease and Doc_7843916_2193_2212_Disease.
7843916	14	2214	This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in Doc_7843916_2309_2325_Disease and Doc_7843916_2330_2357_Disease.

7880714	3	325	Three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 kHz) were made: the first before IBPB, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation.
7880714	4	493	In four patients Doc_7880714_510_528_Disease on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day.
7880714	5	665	The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 kHz) were involved.
7880714	6	797	The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of Doc_7880714_898_909_Chemical.
7880714	7	911	This patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 dB) at 6-10 kHz on the opposite side also.

8045270	4	513	These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively.
8045270	5	628	Moreover, Doc_8045270_638_645_Chemical (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of Doc_8045270_730_758_Chemical (Doc_8045270_760_766_Chemical; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus Doc_8045270_788_799_Chemical (6.25 mg/kg i.p.).
8045270	6	819	These results suggested that Doc_8045270_848_855_Chemical is a centrally active Doc_8045270_878_887_Chemical A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by Doc_8045270_994_1003_Chemical A2A receptor antagonists.

8410199	1	121	In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if Doc_8410199_177_190_Chemical decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to Doc_8410199_291_298_Disease-induced damage in a model of chronic Doc_8410199_336_344_Disease.
8410199	2	346	Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with Doc_8410199_403_414_Chemical, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after Doc_8410199_512_523_Chemical-induced Doc_8410199_532_540_Disease.
8410199	3	542	In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a Doc_8410199_588_599_Chemical-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the Doc_8410199_746_757_Chemical-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals.
8410199	4	818	Additional neuronanatomical studies, including Doc_8410199_865_878_Chemical staining, Doc_8410199_889_910_Disease methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to Doc_8410199_1075_1088_Disease rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels.
8410199	5	1135	The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer.
8410199	6	1313	Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals.
8410199	7	1565	No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer.
8410199	8	1734	The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to Doc_8410199_1877_1884_Disease-induced damage.
8410199	9	1901	Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of Doc_8410199_1990_1994_Chemical neurons.

8441146	3	350	In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants (representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the Doc_8441146_490_492_Disease in each case has been completely quiescent.
8441146	4	537	Although short term remission of severe Doc_8441146_577_579_Disease following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available.
8441146	5	688	This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive Doc_8441146_817_826_Disease.

8600333	2	228	Thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment.
8600333	3	373	Cumulative doses of Doc_8600333_393_404_Chemical were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360).
8600333	4	443	The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography.
8600333	5	621	Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed Doc_8600333_658_674_Disease, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex Doc_8600333_763_786_Disease, left Doc_8600333_793_813_Disease, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction.
8600333	6	878	The incidence of Doc_8600333_895_916_Disease increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05).
8600333	7	967	No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of Doc_8600333_1031_1042_Chemical and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability.
8600333	8	1098	When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients.
8600333	9	1224	The incidence of Doc_8600333_1241_1252_Chemical-induced Doc_8600333_1261_1275_Disease is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose.
8600333	10	1347	Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted.
8600333	11	1407	The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for Doc_8600333_1517_1531_Disease.

8607407	1	92	Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of Doc_8607407_132_140_Chemical are enhanced in Doc_8607407_157_169_Disease persons has not been demonstrated.
8607407	2	205	Thus, Doc_8607407_211_219_Chemical (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions.
8607407	3	348	Borderline Doc_8607407_359_371_Disease men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg.
8607407	4	499	Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of Doc_8607407_558_570_Disease and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg.
8607407	5	608	Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from Doc_8607407_683_691_Chemical in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits.
8607407	6	762	Doc_8607407_762_770_Chemical-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004).
8607407	7	1043	These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols.
8607407	8	1118	The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%.
8607407	9	1231	Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved Doc_8607407_1373_1385_Disease BP levels after Doc_8607407_1402_1410_Chemical ingestion.
8607407	10	1422	Thus, in borderline Doc_8607407_1442_1454_Disease men, exaggerated responses to Doc_8607407_1485_1493_Chemical were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline Doc_8607407_1641_1654_Disease.
8607407	11	1656	We suspect that the potential for Doc_8607407_1690_1698_Chemical to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.

8643966	4	555	We investigated the efficacy and Doc_8643966_588_596_Disease of a 3-hour Doc_8643966_609_619_Chemical infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV Doc_8643966_694_699_Disease.
8643966	5	701	The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2.
8643966	6	839	Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV Doc_8643966_874_879_Disease.
8643966	7	881	Doc_8643966_881_891_Chemical 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication.
8643966	8	983	Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%).
8643966	9	1116	Hematologic Doc_8643966_1128_1138_Disease were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 Doc_8643966_1195_1206_Disease, while 29% had grade 1 or 2.
8643966	10	1236	Grade 1 or 2 Doc_8643966_1249_1263_Disease affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe Doc_8643966_1328_1342_Disease.
8643966	11	1344	Similarly, grade 1 or 2 Doc_8643966_1368_1375_Disease/Doc_8643966_1376_1386_Disease was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4.
8643966	12	1463	Doc_8643966_1463_1469_Disease and Doc_8643966_1474_1482_Disease were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4.
8643966	13	1586	Doc_8643966_1586_1596_Chemical is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic Doc_8643966_1803_1811_Disease.
8643966	14	1813	Further phase II studies with Doc_8643966_1843_1853_Chemical combined with other drugs active against Doc_8643966_1895_1900_Disease are indicated, and phase III studies comparing Doc_8643966_1948_1958_Chemical with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.

8643973	1	93	In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Doc_8643973_155_165_Chemical (Doc_8643973_167_172_Chemical; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with Doc_8643973_266_277_Chemical administered every 21 days to women with advanced Doc_8643973_328_342_Disease, Doc_8643973_344_354_Chemical doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2.
8643973	2	471	The fixed dose of Doc_8643973_489_500_Chemical at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula.
8643973	3	625	In levels 5 and 6 the Doc_8643973_647_658_Chemical dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed Doc_8643973_735_745_Chemical dose of 185 mg/m2.
8643973	4	765	To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study.
8643973	5	930	The dose-limiting Doc_8643973_948_956_Disease of the combination was Doc_8643973_980_996_Disease (Doc_8643973_998_1008_Disease, Doc_8643973_1010_1026_Disease, and Doc_8643973_1032_1048_Disease).
8643973	6	1051	Doc_8643973_1051_1064_Disease was largely moderate.
8643973	7	1087	So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients.
8643973	8	1245	No patient had disease progression.
8643973	9	1281	We conclude that the combination of Doc_8643973_1317_1327_Chemical 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of Doc_8643973_1417_1428_Chemical at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting.
8643973	10	1519	The recommended dose for phase III studies is Doc_8643973_1565_1575_Chemical 185 mg/m2 and Doc_8643973_1590_1601_Chemical AUC 6.
8665051	0	0	Effects of acute Doc_8665051_17_24_Chemical administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats.
8665051	1	87	Occasional case reports have shown that acute Doc_8665051_133_141_Disease may occur in patients treated with massive doses of Doc_8665051_194_209_Chemical.
8665051	2	211	The mechanism of this Doc_8665051_233_241_Disease is poorly understood.
8665051	3	264	Therefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), Doc_8665051_353_371_Chemical (Doc_8665051_373_374_Chemical), or Doc_8665051_380_393_Chemical (Doc_8665051_395_396_Chemical) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant Doc_8665051_489_513_Disease in the Doc_8665051_521_528_Chemical-treated groups (-50 and -79% in Doc_8665051_561_562_Chemical and Doc_8665051_567_568_Chemical, respectively).
8665051	4	585	This was associated with a similar Doc_8665051_620_639_Disease.
8665051	5	641	In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied.
8665051	6	756	Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after Doc_8665051_833_840_Chemical treatment.
8665051	7	852	Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the Doc_8665051_946_947_Chemical group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the Doc_8665051_994_995_Chemical group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS).
8665051	8	1029	Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both Doc_8665051_1072_1079_Chemical groups, and time to peak tension was longer with Doc_8665051_1129_1130_Chemical, whereas Doc_8665051_1140_1147_Disease tensions were similar.
8665051	9	1171	Doc_8665051_1171_1178_Chemical treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05).
8665051	10	1312	ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber Doc_8665051_1403_1410_Disease in the Doc_8665051_1418_1425_Chemical groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa Doc_8665051_1465_1472_Disease with Doc_8665051_1478_1479_Chemical, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of Doc_8665051_1564_1572_Disease.
8665051	11	1574	Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, Doc_8665051_1631_1632_Chemical, and PF), showed that Doc_8665051_1655_1669_Disease was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in Doc_8665051_1725_1726_Chemical-treated animals.
8665051	12	1744	We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of Doc_8665051_1808_1816_Chemical induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of Doc_8665051_1887_1895_Chemical induced predominantly type IIb Doc_8665051_1927_1934_Disease, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither Doc_8665051_2023_2030_Chemical caused muscle Doc_8665051_2045_2053_Disease; (4) type IIb Doc_8665051_2068_2075_Disease was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.
8677458	0	0	Continuous subcutaneous administration of Doc_8677458_42_47_Chemical to prevent Doc_8677458_59_69_Chemical-induced Doc_8677458_78_98_Disease.
8677458	1	100	Doc_8677458_100_120_Disease is a major potential Doc_8677458_142_150_Disease of Doc_8677458_154_164_Chemical that can be prevented by administering Doc_8677458_204_209_Chemical along with the cytotoxic agent.
8677458	2	242	Doc_8677458_242_247_Chemical is generally administered by the intravenous route, although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased.
8677458	3	366	The continuous subcutaneous administration of Doc_8677458_412_417_Chemical has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access.
8677458	4	473	In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary Doc_8677458_593_598_Chemical concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral Doc_8677458_648_653_Chemical who experiences severe Doc_8677458_677_687_Chemical-induced Doc_8677458_696_702_Disease and is unable to absorb the drug.
8677458	5	737	Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous Doc_8677458_794_799_Chemical administration suggests it is a safe, practical, and economic method of drug delivery that permits Doc_8677458_899_909_Chemical to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting.

8686832	2	209	Thirteen of these patients experienced Doc_8686832_248_276_Disease after recovery from anaesthesia.
8686832	3	310	The patients affected were younger (p < 0.05) and the site of the dural puncture was higher (p < 0.01) than those individuals without Doc_8686832_444_448_Disease.
8686832	4	450	Five of the 13 patients (38%) with Doc_8686832_485_489_Disease and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without Doc_8686832_533_537_Disease admitted to a high Doc_8686832_557_564_Chemical intake, which might be a contributing factor.
8686832	5	611	Doc_8686832_611_631_Disease is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% Doc_8686832_688_698_Chemical.

871943	2	232	Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection.
871943	3	341	In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase.
871943	4	449	In three patients none of the usual variants were found.
871943	5	506	It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze Doc_871943_612_627_Chemical.
871943	6	629	The use of serum cholinesterase in Doc_871943_664_679_Chemical Doc_871943_680_686_Disease provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.

873132	1	125	Doc_873132_125_141_Chemical conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and Doc_873132_219_236_Chemical-treated rats.
873132	2	251	Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport Doc_873132_313_329_Chemical than Doc_873132_335_356_Chemical, and both were decreased by Doc_873132_385_402_Chemical treatment.
873132	3	414	During [24-14C]Doc_873132_429_448_Chemical infusion, [14C]biliary Doc_873132_472_481_Chemical secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or Doc_873132_567_584_Chemical-treated rats.
873132	4	599	Doc_873132_599_616_Chemical-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as Doc_873132_668_684_Chemical than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of Doc_873132_768_789_Chemical.
873132	5	791	Doc_873132_791_808_Chemical treatment did not impair conjugation of Doc_873132_849_865_Chemical, but did result in an increase in sulfation of Doc_873132_913_934_Chemical from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01).
873132	6	992	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for Doc_873132_1081_1097_Chemical than do certain other species.
873132	7	1129	Furthermore, the rat converts Doc_873132_1159_1175_Chemical, a poor choleretic, to Doc_873132_1199_1215_Chemical, a good choleretic.
873132	8	1236	When this conversion is impaired with Doc_873132_1274_1291_Chemical treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful Doc_873132_1393_1402_Chemical.

8742498	1	82	Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of Doc_8742498_140_160_Chemical, a selective inhibitor of Doc_8742498_187_203_Chemical polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from Doc_8742498_258_271_Chemical (Doc_8742498_273_276_Chemical)-Doc_8742498_278_287_Disease, suggesting that the Doc_8742498_309_312_Chemical-induced Doc_8742498_321_333_Disease involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation.
8742498	2	386	The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of Doc_8742498_461_464_Chemical, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with Doc_8742498_525_528_Chemical Doc_8742498_529_538_Disease and evaluates the influence of simultaneous Doc_8742498_583_590_Chemical consumption in these animals.
8742498	3	621	Doc_8742498_621_635_Disease were quantified as serum activities of Doc_8742498_675_684_Chemical-Doc_8742498_685_697_Chemical transaminase (GOT) and Doc_8742498_721_730_Chemical-Doc_8742498_731_739_Chemical transaminase (GPT).
8742498	4	760	While Doc_8742498_766_769_Chemical caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by Doc_8742498_914_921_Chemical and inhibited by Doc_8742498_939_959_Chemical (Doc_8742498_961_964_Chemical), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of Doc_8742498_1038_1041_Chemical.
8742498	5	1043	In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of Doc_8742498_1148_1151_Chemical, and unlike the exacerbation caused by Doc_8742498_1191_1198_Chemical in mice on a standard diet, the Doc_8742498_1231_1243_Disease was inhibited by 50% by Doc_8742498_1268_1275_Chemical.
8742498	6	1277	A further 64% reduction of Doc_8742498_1304_1313_Disease was observed, when Doc_8742498_1333_1336_Chemical was given to Doc_8742498_1350_1357_Chemical/Doc_8742498_1358_1361_Chemical-mice.
8742498	7	1368	Our results provide evidence that the Doc_8742498_1406_1409_Chemical-induced Doc_8742498_1418_1427_Disease and its exacerbation by Doc_8742498_1452_1459_Chemical can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by Doc_8742498_1519_1522_Chemical or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate Doc_8742498_1573_1576_Chemical.
8742498	8	1578	We see the main application of Doc_8742498_1609_1612_Chemical as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of Doc_8742498_1676_1689_Chemical in order to avoid Doc_8742498_1708_1722_Disease in patients treated with this widely used analgesic.

9067481	2	376	To further our understanding of the mechanism of Doc_9067481_425_427_Chemical cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of Doc_9067481_501_503_Chemical and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of Doc_9067481_543_545_Chemical, Doc_9067481_547_579_Chemical, Doc_9067481_581_590_Chemical (Doc_9067481_592_595_Chemical) against Doc_9067481_605_618_Chemical-, Doc_9067481_621_631_Chemical-, Doc_9067481_634_654_Chemical-, Doc_9067481_657_667_Chemical- and Doc_9067481_673_686_Chemical-induced Doc_9067481_695_703_Disease.
9067481	3	705	The results of these studies demonstrated that Doc_9067481_752_754_Chemical-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical.
9067481	4	850	A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of Doc_9067481_914_916_Chemical (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the Doc_9067481_982_993_Disease effects of Doc_9067481_1005_1009_Chemical, Doc_9067481_1011_1016_Chemical, Doc_9067481_1018_1031_Chemical and Doc_9067481_1036_1049_Chemical and against the lethal (and presumably Doc_9067481_1089_1100_Disease) effect of Doc_9067481_1112_1122_Chemical administration.
9067481	5	1139	Maximal Doc_9067481_1147_1149_Chemical-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult.
9067481	6	1250	These data suggest that Doc_9067481_1274_1276_Chemical intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death.
9067481	7	1374	The mechanism of Doc_9067481_1391_1393_Chemical protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against Doc_9067481_1559_1572_Chemical Doc_9067481_1573_1587_Disease).
9067481	8	1590	However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that Doc_9067481_1668_1670_Chemical administration inhibits chemical bioactivation.
9067481	9	1719	Our findings do suggest that Doc_9067481_1748_1750_Chemical-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic Doc_9067481_1820_1822_Chemical molecule (non-hydrolyzable Doc_9067481_1850_1853_Chemical was as protective as Doc_9067481_1875_1877_Chemical), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.

9098464	1	192	The aim of this study was to investigate whether Doc_9098464_252_262_Chemical given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused Doc_9098464_311_329_Disease and its effects with respect to Doc_9098464_362_373_Disease.
9098464	2	375	Doc_9098464_383_393_Chemical, a Doc_9098464_397_406_Chemical reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce Doc_9098464_482_500_Disease.
9098464	3	502	The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls.

9098464	6	904	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum prolactin levels, uterine histopathology.
9098464	7	975	The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with Doc_9098464_1055_1065_Chemical were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups.
9098464	8	1156	Histological studies revealed 11 cases of Doc_9098464_1198_1209_Disease, all within the noncastrated group receiving Doc_9098464_1255_1265_Chemical.
9098464	9	1267	It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian Doc_9098464_1395_1403_Chemical that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma.

9121607	1	122	Several structurally related metabolites of Doc_9121607_166_178_Chemical (Doc_9121607_180_212_Chemical) and Doc_9121607_218_237_Chemical (Doc_9121607_239_279_Chemical) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against Doc_9121607_353_364_Chemical-, Doc_9121607_367_378_Chemical- and Doc_9121607_384_404_Chemical (Doc_9121607_406_410_Chemical)-induced Doc_9121607_420_428_Disease in mice.
9121607	2	438	Doc_9121607_438_446_Chemical with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against Doc_9121607_583_594_Chemical (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor Doc_9121607_634_642_Disease and Doc_9121607_647_665_Disease (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.).
9121607	3	703	The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.).
9121607	4	843	Although the neuroactive Doc_9121607_868_876_Chemical were considerably less potent than the Doc_9121607_916_930_Chemical Doc_9121607_931_941_Chemical in protecting against Doc_9121607_964_975_Chemical Doc_9121607_976_984_Disease, Doc_9121607_986_994_Chemical with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for Doc_9121607_1130_1137_Disease protection) than Doc_9121607_1155_1165_Chemical, indicating that some neuroactive Doc_9121607_1200_1208_Chemical may have lower relative Doc_9121607_1233_1241_Disease.
9121607	5	1243	Doc_9121607_1243_1251_Chemical with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic Doc_9121607_1371_1379_Disease induced by Doc_9121607_1391_1402_Chemical (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the Doc_9121607_1464_1472_Disease.
9121607	6	1474	However, when a second dose of the Doc_9121607_1509_1516_Chemical was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the Doc_9121607_1590_1601_Chemical-induced limbic Doc_9121607_1617_1625_Disease and Doc_9121607_1630_1648_Disease was obtained.
9121607	7	1663	The Doc_9121607_1667_1675_Chemical also caused a dose-dependent delay in Doc_9121607_1714_1718_Chemical (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against Doc_9121607_1795_1799_Chemical Doc_9121607_1800_1808_Disease or lethality.
9121607	8	1823	We conclude that neuroactive Doc_9121607_1852_1860_Chemical are highly effective in protecting against Doc_9121607_1904_1915_Chemical- and Doc_9121607_1921_1932_Chemical-induced Doc_9121607_1941_1949_Disease and Doc_9121607_1954_1972_Disease in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of Doc_9121607_2038_2056_Disease in humans.

9154656	2	228	In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of angiotensinogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, Doc_9154656_462_471_Disease, and pair-fed (PF) rats.
9154656	3	497	Doc_9154656_497_499_Disease was induced by a single injection of Doc_9154656_537_563_Chemical (Doc_9154656_565_568_Chemical).
9154656	4	571	Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after Doc_9154656_671_674_Chemical injection, when Doc_9154656_691_693_Disease was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change.
9154656	5	758	Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after Doc_9154656_913_916_Chemical injection.
9154656	6	928	These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute Doc_9154656_1046_1048_Disease induced by Doc_9154656_1060_1063_Chemical.

9165568	3	314	The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of Doc_9165568_372_395_Disease with Doc_9165568_401_412_Chemical at low dosages.
9165568	4	429	With this low frequency of Doc_9165568_456_479_Disease, it was thought the frequency of Doc_9165568_513_543_Disease might also be lowered.

9165568	6	664	The syndrome reversed after discontinuing Doc_9165568_706_717_Chemical and starting treatment with Doc_9165568_746_756_Chemical and Doc_9165568_761_774_Chemical.
9165568	7	776	It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with Doc_9165568_854_865_Chemical does not ensure protection from Doc_9165568_898_928_Disease.
9201797	0	0	The attenuating effect of Doc_9201797_26_49_Chemical, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced Doc_9201797_106_115_Disease in rats.
9201797	1	125	It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of Doc_9201797_206_215_Disease, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment.
9201797	2	297	Neuroleptic-induced Doc_9201797_317_326_Disease, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced Doc_9201797_458_467_Disease in humans, although neuroleptic-induced Doc_9201797_508_517_Disease was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced Doc_9201797_577_586_Disease.
9201797	3	588	Therefore, the effects of Doc_9201797_614_623_Chemical, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on Doc_9201797_660_671_Chemical-induced Doc_9201797_680_689_Disease in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of Doc_9201797_751_762_Chemical and Doc_9201797_767_776_Chemical, a muscarinic receptor antagonist.

9201797	5	906	The inhibitory effect of Doc_9201797_931_940_Chemical was almost comparable to that of Doc_9201797_974_985_Chemical, but was weaker than that of Doc_9201797_1015_1024_Chemical.
9201797	6	1026	Doc_9201797_1026_1035_Chemical did not evoke postsynaptic Doc_9201797_1063_1071_Chemical receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and Doc_9201797_1133_1148_Disease in rats.
9201797	7	1158	Doc_9201797_1158_1167_Chemical did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of Doc_9201797_1213_1224_Chemical on Doc_9201797_1228_1239_Chemical-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats.
9201797	8	1291	In addition, Doc_9201797_1304_1313_Chemical did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit Doc_9201797_1440_1459_Chemical-induced head twitch in rats.
9201797	9	1489	Finally, Doc_9201797_1498_1507_Chemical did not inhibit Doc_9201797_1524_1537_Chemical-induced lethality in rats.
9201797	10	1565	These results strongly suggest that Doc_9201797_1601_1610_Chemical improves Doc_9201797_1620_1631_Chemical-induced Doc_9201797_1640_1649_Disease via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of Doc_9201797_1750_1759_Disease without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic Doc_9201797_1846_1854_Chemical receptor antagonistic activity.

9214597	2	340	The mechanistic details of Doc_9214597_367_372_Disease angiogenesis induction, during Doc_9214597_404_412_Chemical Doc_9214597_413_427_Disease, are still unknown.
9214597	3	448	To elucidate the role of Doc_9214597_473_481_Chemical in the regulation of Doc_9214597_503_508_Disease angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.
9214597	4	823	The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry.
9214597	5	918	The results demonstrated that Doc_9214597_948_964_Chemical (Doc_9214597_966_968_Chemical) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure.
9214597	6	1079	The high Doc_9214597_1088_1093_Disease angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the Doc_9214597_1182_1184_Chemical exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats.
9214597	7	1234	VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells.
9214597	8	1456	After 15 days of Doc_9214597_1473_1475_Chemical exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels.
9214597	9	1613	The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear.
9214597	10	1672	Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of Doc_9214597_1853_1855_Chemical exposure.
9214597	11	1866	These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of Doc_9214597_2013_2021_Chemical induced Doc_9214597_2030_2035_Disease angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.

9226773	2	174	Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have Doc_9226773_225_232_Chemical-induced Doc_9226773_241_271_Disease, and Doc_9226773_277_284_Chemical therapy had been discontinued.
9226773	3	316	He remained thirsty and Doc_9226773_340_348_Disease despite cessation of Doc_9226773_370_377_Chemical and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and Doc_9226773_461_472_Chemical secretion, with clear evidence of Doc_9226773_507_537_Disease.
9226773	4	539	Doc_9226773_539_546_Chemical induced Doc_9226773_555_585_Disease is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but Doc_9226773_645_653_Disease persisted in this patient for ten years after Doc_9226773_700_707_Chemical was stopped.

9228650	2	267	Doc_9228650_267_274_Chemical, Doc_9228650_276_283_Chemical and Doc_9228650_288_294_Chemical all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively).
9228650	3	442	In addition, Doc_9228650_455_462_Chemical and Doc_9228650_467_474_Chemical, but not Doc_9228650_484_490_Chemical, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum.
9228650	4	556	All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity.
9228650	5	616	Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Doc_9228650_651_658_Chemical on AChE was reversible.
9228650	6	683	All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the Doc_9228650_744_751_Disease induced by Doc_9228650_763_774_Chemical (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.
9228650	7	837	The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats.
9228650	8	940	These findings suggest that Doc_9228650_968_975_Chemical at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves Doc_9228650_1018_1029_Chemical-induced Doc_9228650_1038_1045_Disease but does not affect spontaneous movement.
9228650	9	1088	The findings suggest that Doc_9228650_1114_1121_Chemical may be a useful drug for the treatment of Doc_9228650_1164_1183_Disease.

9270571	1	138	The clinical utility of Doc_9270571_162_170_Chemical (Doc_9270571_172_174_Chemical) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Doc_9270571_217_236_Disease (Doc_9270571_238_240_Disease) is still unclear.
9270571	2	260	The therapeutic use of selective Doc_9270571_293_295_Chemical D1 receptor agonists such as Doc_9270571_325_334_Chemical (Doc_9270571_336_425_Chemical) and Doc_9270571_431_438_Chemical (Doc_9270571_440_535_Chemical) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for Doc_9270571_611_620_Chemical (< 1 hr) and too long for Doc_9270571_647_654_Chemical (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance).
9270571	3	699	We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four Doc_9270571_768_812_Chemical (Doc_9270571_814_818_Chemical)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit Doc_9270571_865_873_Chemical-induced Doc_9270571_882_893_Disease to evaluate the locomotor and Doc_9270571_924_934_Disease effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of Doc_9270571_1000_1007_Chemical (Doc_9270571_1009_1114_Chemical), a selective and full Doc_9270571_1138_1140_Chemical D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action.
9270571	4	1207	Doc_9270571_1207_1215_Chemical and the Doc_9270571_1224_1226_Chemical D2-like receptor agonist, Doc_9270571_1253_1262_Chemical (Doc_9270571_1264_1354_Chemical) were also used for comparison.
9270571	5	1387	Acute administration of Doc_9270571_1411_1418_Chemical was as efficacious in alleviating Doc_9270571_1453_1457_Chemical-induced Doc_9270571_1466_1478_Disease as Doc_9270571_1482_1490_Chemical and Doc_9270571_1495_1504_Chemical, but was less likely to reproduce the Doc_9270571_1543_1551_Chemical-induced Doc_9270571_1560_1571_Disease in these animals than with either Doc_9270571_1606_1615_Chemical or subsequent challenge of Doc_9270571_1643_1651_Chemical.
9270571	6	1653	Selective stimulation of the Doc_9270571_1682_1684_Chemical D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with Doc_9270571_1860_1868_Chemical and selective Doc_9270571_1883_1885_Chemical D2 receptor agonist.
9270571	7	1907	Potent Doc_9270571_1914_1916_Chemical D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as Doc_9270571_1986_1993_Chemical (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in Doc_9270571_2073_2075_Disease and merit further attention.

9305828	1	84	Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental Doc_9305828_205_227_Disease (Doc_9305828_229_232_Disease).
9305828	2	235	This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block Doc_9305828_331_338_Disease-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices.
9305828	3	411	The Doc_9305828_415_426_Chemical (Doc_9305828_428_432_Chemical) model of Doc_9305828_443_451_Disease is characterized by an acute period of Doc_9305828_491_509_Disease followed by spontaneous recurrent Doc_9305828_544_552_Disease and related Doc_9305828_565_577_Disease.
9305828	4	579	We report peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model.
9305828	5	678	Doc_9305828_678_682_Chemical-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells.
9305828	6	870	NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and sensorimotor areas.
9305828	7	980	In addition, Doc_9305828_993_997_Chemical injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls.
9305828	8	1110	The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the Doc_9305828_1284_1288_Chemical model of Doc_9305828_1298_1301_Disease.

9321531	1	67	Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Doc_9321531_179_198_Disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up.
9321531	2	290	Forty patients with Doc_9321531_319_338_Disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ("off" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ("on" period).
9321531	3	483	All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years.
9321531	4	633	The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral Doc_9321531_1009_1020_Disease, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral Doc_9321531_1121_1132_Disease, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent).
9321531	5	1197	The improvements in Doc_9321531_1217_1228_Disease and the total scores for off-period Doc_9321531_1265_1277_Disease, contralateral Doc_9321531_1293_1305_Disease, and Doc_9321531_1311_1319_Disease were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years.
9321531	6	1377	The improvement in ipsilateral Doc_9321531_1408_1419_Disease was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months.
9321531	7	1530	Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery.
9321531	8	1696	The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication.
9321531	9	1820	In late-stage Doc_9321531_1847_1866_Disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces Doc_9321531_1902_1910_Chemical-induced Doc_9321531_1919_1930_Disease and off-period disability.
9321531	10	1958	Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year.
9321531	11	2122	The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.

9431903	3	513	The entire procedure was repeated during Doc_9431903_554_573_Chemical infusion (Doc_9431903_584_596_Chemical 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min).
9431903	4	627	Doc_9431903_636_647_Chemical-Doc_9431903_648_656_Chemical provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete Doc_9431903_1080_1085_Disease at the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
9431903	5	1125	Doc_9431903_1125_1144_Chemical infusion completely normalized the Doc_9431903_1180_1191_Chemical-Doc_9431903_1192_1200_Chemical-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of Doc_9431903_1507_1526_Chemical.

950631	2	188	Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal.
950631	3	341	Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity.
950631	4	507	Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3.
950631	5	598	The findings were similar to those in early Doc_950631_642_671_Disease, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4.
950631	6	790	It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.

9514561	1	62	Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in Doc_9514561_141_149_Disease without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the Doc_9514561_221_229_Disease state, but not in the Doc_9514561_252_260_Disease free interval.
9514561	2	276	It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the Doc_9514561_344_352_Disease attack itself and represents the so called 'Doc_9514561_397_405_Disease generator'.
9514561	3	418	To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental Doc_9514561_471_475_Disease study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the Doc_9514561_567_575_Disease patients.
9514561	4	586	A small amount of Doc_9514561_604_613_Chemical was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning Doc_9514561_687_694_Disease sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve.
9514561	5	752	Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum.
9514561	6	913	Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned Doc_9514561_980_988_Disease study no brain stem activation was found in the acute Doc_9514561_1043_1047_Disease state compared to the Doc_9514561_1070_1074_Disease free state.
9514561	7	1087	The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted Doc_9514561_1245_1249_Disease as such, rather than in a specific type of Doc_9514561_1293_1301_Disease as was suggested for Doc_9514561_1323_1339_Disease.

9523850	3	331	The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous (i.v.) administration of Doc_9523850_459_477_Chemical (Doc_9523850_479_481_Chemical) prevents this complication.
9523850	4	511	Sixty-five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI (group 1), 125 mg i.v. Doc_9523850_648_650_Chemical before and saline after TDI (group 2), or 125 mg i.v. Doc_9523850_705_707_Chemical before and after TDI (group 3).
9523850	5	740	Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity.
9523850	6	838	Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI.
9523850	7	936	The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0.
9523850	8	1088	Data were analyzed by the two-sided Fisher's exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf.
9523850	9	1208	These data demonstrate that administration of Doc_9523850_1254_1256_Chemical before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the Doc_9523850_1320_1330_Disease-Doc_9523850_1331_1338_Disease syndrome.
9523850	10	1349	We conclude that 125 mg i.v. Doc_9523850_1378_1380_Chemical should be given routinely before and after TDI of Doc_9523850_1431_1443_Chemical.

9564988	3	347	All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy.
9564988	4	468	Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results.
9564988	5	587	Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s).
9564988	6	713	The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
9564988	7	853	Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%.

9630698	2	298	Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (MMG) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior.
9630698	3	631	Doc_9630698_631_646_Disease was induced by Doc_9630698_662_673_Chemical (2.5 mg/kg i.p.).

9875685	2	237	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. Doc_9875685_300_310_Chemical (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups.
9875685	3	356	Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of Doc_9875685_404_414_Chemical and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily.
9875685	4	490	Doc_9875685_490_500_Chemical serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay.
9875685	5	588	The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment.
9875685	6	700	The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function.
9875685	7	798	No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose.
9875685	8	913	Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%).
9875685	9	975	Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01).
9875685	10	1076	Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01).
9875685	11	1198	The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD).
9875685	12	1462	Increased serum Doc_9875685_1478_1488_Chemical was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of Doc_9875685_1577_1591_Disease.
9875685	13	1593	In TD group, three patients developed Doc_9875685_1631_1658_Disease, of which one presented with an Doc_9875685_1691_1704_Disease of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented Doc_9875685_1767_1794_Disease.
9875685	14	1796	This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of Doc_9875685_1870_1880_Chemical is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen.
9875685	15	1978	Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.

9952311	2	270	Earlier observations that Doc_9952311_296_299_Chemical interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate Doc_9952311_413_416_Chemical's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with Doc_9952311_526_529_Chemical for several weeks.
9952311	3	549	At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy.
9952311	4	714	In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes.
9952311	5	935	Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies.
9952311	6	1037	Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with Doc_9952311_1090_1093_Chemical caused Doc_9952311_1101_1127_Disease characterized by Doc_9952311_1145_1156_Disease, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent Doc_9952311_1332_1340_Disease, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.
9952311	7	1440	Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by Doc_9952311_1612_1615_Chemical treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver.
9952311	8	1673	Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of Doc_9952311_1799_1802_Chemical on cardiovascular function involve Doc_9952311_1838_1888_Disease.
