10027919	0	0	22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure.
10027919	1	121	BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease.
10027919	2	372	A new vitamin D analogue, 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics.
10027919	3	472	This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function.
10027919	4	616	METHODS: Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized (Nx, N = 38) or sham-operated (Sham, N = 22).
10027919	5	709	The animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance PTH secretion.
10027919	6	779	Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks.
10027919	7	963	Thereafter, the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months.
10027919	8	1074	Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after OCT or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period.
10027919	9	1296	RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency.
10027919	10	1411	In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, OCT (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months.
10027919	11	1533	Serum PTH levels rose thereafter, but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control.
10027919	12	1657	These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.
10027919	13	1740	In animals with normal renal function, OCT induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses.
10027919	14	1912	In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover.
10027919	15	2058	In addition, OCT improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs.
10027919	16	2184	CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.
10074612	0	0	Hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient.
10074612	1	110	We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode.
10074612	2	335	There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier.
10074612	3	400	The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.
10074612	4	588	After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm.
10074612	5	682	The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia.
10074612	6	749	This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP).
10074612	7	876	These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event.
10074612	8	1001	Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.
10091616	0	0	Worsening of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks.
10091616	1	69	Ten patients who had Parkinson's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine.
10091616	2	461	Compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05).
10091616	3	776	These results suggest that activation tasks such as "speaking aloud" could be used for objective assessment of dyskinesia severity.
10193809	0	0	Urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase--a marker of tubular damage?
10193809	1	67	BACKGROUND: Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction, an increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells.
10193809	2	266	METHODS: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria.
10193809	3	370	Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days.
10193809	4	493	The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three.
10193809	5	674	RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four.
10193809	6	817	After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity.
10193809	7	936	Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards.
10193809	8	1056	Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four.
10193809	9	1128	Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards).
10193809	10	1310	CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells.
10193809	11	1488	Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.
10225068	0	0	Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997.
10225068	1	185	Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997.
10225068	2	325	All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
10225068	3	401	Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block.
10225068	4	512	The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.
10225068	5	588	Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
10225068	6	684	In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology.
10225068	7	853	All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits.
10225068	8	906	We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.
10328196	0	0	Systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus (formerly rapamycin) for psoriasis: association of capillary leak syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes.
10328196	1	171	BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation.
10328196	2	284	After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis.
10328196	3	494	OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus-induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus-treated patient with psoriasis (21%).
10328196	4	737	Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus.
10328196	5	942	CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever, anemia, and capillary leak syndrome.
10328196	6	1043	These symptoms may be the result of drug-induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes, especially activated T lymphocytes, and possibly release of inflammatory mediators.
10328196	7	1210	Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.
10354657	0	0	Effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function.
10354657	1	75	OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations.
10354657	2	206	These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease).
10354657	3	384	DESIGN: Prospective study.
10354657	4	411	SETTING: Affective Disorders Clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, Montreal.
10354657	5	481	PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration.
10354657	6	647	The control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics.
10354657	7	781	OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at biannual follow-up.
10354657	8	950	RESULTS: Hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline.
10354657	9	1055	All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of lithium therapy).
10354657	10	1301	Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%).
10354657	11	1426	Magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline levels.
10354657	12	1513	After lithium treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels.
10354657	13	1612	Thus, lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging.
10354657	14	1710	CONCLUSIONS: Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during lithium therapy.
10411803	0	0	Severe immune hemolytic anemia associated with prophylactic use of cefotetan in obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
10411803	1	118	Second- and third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotetan, are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune hemolytic anemia.
10411803	2	267	We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan-induced hemolytic anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
10411803	3	444	Eight of these cases of severe immune hemolytic anemia are described.
10414674	0	0	Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
10414674	1	115	Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties.
10414674	2	239	Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate.
10414674	3	313	Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH.
10414674	4	610	Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively.
10414674	5	662	Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings.
10414674	6	787	Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen.
10414674	7	907	Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day.
10414674	8	1051	In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (P < .05).
10414674	9	1235	One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma.
10414674	10	1320	Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups.
10414674	11	1498	Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH.
10414674	12	1580	If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage.
10523326	0	0	Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead-induced hypertension.
10523326	1	77	We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced hypertension.
10523326	2	294	This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression.
10523326	3	455	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E-fortified food for 12 weeks.
10523326	4	751	Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured.
10523326	5	923	The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.
10523326	6	1122	Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.
10523326	7	1328	Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group.
10523326	8	1446	The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations.
10523326	9	1554	In conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression.
10523326	10	1705	This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.
10524660	0	0	Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura.
10524660	1	97	Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception.
10524660	2	273	In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura.
10524660	3	427	In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura.
10524660	4	674	The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced.
10524660	5	784	Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls.
10524660	6	830	Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject.
10524660	7	878	Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008).
10524660	8	1041	In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion.
10524660	9	1203	At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society.
10524660	10	1359	The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura.
10524660	11	1455	Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.
10533019	0	0	Rapid reversal of life-threatening diltiazem-induced tetany with calcium chloride.
10533019	1	83	We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem.
10533019	2	202	The administration of calcium chloride rapidly resolved the patient's tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function, averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support.
10533019	3	406	The emergency physician should be aware that life-threatening tetany may accompany the administration of intravenous diltiazem and that calcium chloride may be a rapid and effective remedy.
10539815	0	0	Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD)
10539815	1	191	BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it may also cause decreased renal function.
10539815	2	377	Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication.
10539815	3	478	OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.
10539815	4	650	METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF.
10539815	5	825	There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days.
10539815	6	999	Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline.
10539815	7	1110	We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy.
10539815	8	1406	RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003).
10539815	9	1537	By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective.
10539815	10	1772	Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).
10539815	11	2060	Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66).
10539815	12	2255	Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes.
10539815	13	2419	A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96).
10539815	14	2615	CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF.
10539815	15	2726	Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk.
10539815	16	2777	Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy.
10565806	0	0	Hypomania-like syndrome induced by olanzapine.
10565806	1	47	We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified psychotic disorder (DSM-IV) who developed hypomania shortly after the introduction of olanzapine treatment.
10692744	0	0	Acetazolamide-induced Gerstmann syndrome.
10692744	1	42	Acute confusion induced by acetazolamide is a well known adverse drug reaction in patients with renal impairment.
10692744	2	156	We report a case of acetazolamide-induced Gerstmann syndrome in a patient with normal renal function, to highlight predisposing factors that are frequently overlooked.
10728962	0	0	Vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone-induced hypotension in severe heart failure.
10728962	1	87	The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension.
10728962	2	260	In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone, low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone.
10743694	0	0	Treatment of tacrolimus-related adverse effects by conversion to cyclosporine in liver transplant recipients.
10743694	1	110	When tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction, conversion to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression (CyA) is necessary.
10743694	2	242	We characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion.
10743694	3	358	Of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA.
10743694	4	467	We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion.
10743694	5	665	Conversion was early in 29 patients (41.4%) and late in 41 (58.6%).
10743694	6	733	Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), IDDM (12), nephrotoxicity (3), GI toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (PTLD) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1).
10743694	7	1151	All early-conversion patients showed improvement/resolution of symptoms.
10743694	8	1224	Among late-conversion patients, 37 (90.2%) had improvement/resolution; in 4 (9.8%), adverse effects persisted.
10743694	9	1335	The overall rejection rate was 30%.
10743694	10	1371	Sixty-two patients (88.6%) are alive with functioning grafts 686 +/- 362 days (range, 154-1433 days) after conversion.
10743694	11	1490	When tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.
1079693	0	0	Ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
1079693	1	56	We followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven years.
1079693	2	137	Thirty-six of the 210 patients (17.2%) developed iridocyclitis.
1079693	3	201	Iridocyclitis was seen most frequently in young female patients (0 to 4 years) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the arthritis.
1079693	4	344	However, 30% of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of age.
1079693	5	414	Although 61% of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry, 42% had active uveitis on entry.
1079693	6	519	Our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cases.
1079693	7	631	Forty-four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms, such as red eye, ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, or photophobia, in order of decreasing frequency.
1079693	8	828	Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics.
1079693	9	1009	Despite this, there was a dramatic decrease in the 50% incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studies.
1079693	10	1137	Cataract and band keratopathy occurred in only 22 and 13% of our group, respectively.
1079693	11	1223	We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs.
1079693	12	1359	Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found.
1079693	13	1498	Typical keratoconjunctivitis sicca developed in three of the uveitis cases.
1079693	14	1574	This association with uveitis and JRA was not noted previously.
1079693	15	1638	Surgical treatment of cataracts, band keratopathy, and glaucoma achieved uniformly discouraging results.
10840460	0	0	Cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in freely-moving conscious rats: behavioral approach to a new model of visceral pain.
10840460	1	120	PURPOSE: To develop a model of visceral pain in rats using a behavioral approach.
10840460	2	202	Cyclophosphamide (CP), an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein, was used to induce cystitis.
10840460	3	370	MATERIALS AND METHODS: CP was administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg./kg. i.p. to male rats, and their behavior observed and scored.
10840460	4	508	The effects of morphine (0.5 to 4 mg./kg. i.v.) on CP-induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone (1 mg./kg. s.c.).
10840460	5	663	In addition, 90 minutes after CP injection, that is, at the time of administration of morphine, the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination.
10840460	6	826	Finally, to show that the bladder is essential for the CP-induced behavioral modifications, female rats also received CP at doses of 200 mg./kg. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route, and acrolein at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg./kg. i.v. RESULTS: CP dose-relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats: breathing rate decrease, closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures.
10840460	7	1261	Morphine dose-dependently reversed these behavioral disorders.
10840460	8	1324	A dose of 0.5 mg./kg. produced a reduction of almost 50% of the behavioral score induced by CP 200 mg./kg.
10840460	9	1431	This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone.
10840460	10	1499	At the time of administration of morphine, histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer edema, were observed.
10840460	11	1647	In female rats, CP 200 mg./kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats.
10840460	12	1765	Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, CP did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas acrolein at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg./kg. i.p., with the same maximal levels.
10840460	13	2011	Conversely, acrolein 5 mg./kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all.
10840460	14	2094	CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of CP-induced cystitis may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain, allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.
10910842	0	0	Prednisolone-induced muscle dysfunction is caused more by atrophy than by altered acetylcholine receptor expression.
10910842	1	117	Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood.
10910842	2	265	We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of prednisolone on muscle function and pharmacology, and their relationship to changes in muscle size and acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression.
10910842	3	469	With institutional approval, 35 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg/kg prednisolone (P10 group), 100 mg/kg prednisolone (P100 group), or an equal volume of saline (S group) for 7 days.
10910842	4	707	A fourth group of rats was pair fed (food restricted) with the P100 rats for 7 days (FR group).
10910842	5	803	On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of d-tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs.
10910842	6	1041	Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P100, FR, and P10 groups compared with the S group.
10910842	7	1139	Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups.
10910842	8	1219	The evoked peak twitch and tetanic tensions were less in the P100 group than in the P10 or S groups, however, tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P100 group than in the S group.
10910842	9	1417	The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine (microg/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +/- 9.6) groups.
10910842	10	1595	AChR expression was less in the P10 group than in the S group.
10910842	11	1658	The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR.
10910842	12	1770	The 50% effective dose of d-tubocurarine did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression.
10910842	13	1866	Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from muscle atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression.
10910842	14	2054	IMPLICATIONS: The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear.
10910842	15	2185	We suggest that the observed effects are dose-dependent and derive primarily from muscle atrophy and derive less from changes in acetylcholine receptor expression.
11009181	0	0	Apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for Parkinson's disease.
11009181	1	63	Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
11009181	2	159	While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study.
11009181	3	397	A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings.
11009181	4	721	Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors.
11009181	5	968	Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy.
11009181	6	1077	In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
11009181	7	1278	The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role.
11009181	8	1453	Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.
11022397	0	0	Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses.
11022397	1	61	OBJECTIVE: The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied.
11022397	2	361	This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine.
11022397	3	521	Scopolamine was used as a positive control to detect age-dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly.
11022397	4	647	DESIGN: Randomized double-blind controlled trial.
11022397	5	697	PARTICIPANTS: Ten healthy elderly (mean age 70) and 9 young (mean age 33) volunteers.
11022397	6	783	INTERVENTIONS: Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours.
11022397	7	884	The study involved 4 sessions.
11022397	8	915	In 1 session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other.
11022397	9	1014	In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other.
11022397	10	1211	All eye drops were given in a randomized order.
11022397	11	1259	In 2 separate sessions, a single dose of scopolamine (0.5 mg, intravenously) or placebo was administered, and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours.
11022397	12	1467	OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine; scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall.
11022397	13	1611	RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to tropicamide at any time point (p > 0.05).
11022397	14	1760	The elderly group had a significantly greater pilocarpine-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05).
11022397	15	1946	Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced impairment in word recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05).
11022397	16	2109	CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with tropicamide.
11022397	17	2215	Thus, pilocarpine may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.
11027904	0	0	Pain responses in methadone-maintained opioid abusers.
11027904	1	55	Providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task, in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic requirements.
11027904	2	226	This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60).
11027904	3	455	By using a placebo-controlled, two-way factorial design, tolerance to cold-pressor (CP) pain was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid (hydromorphone 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac 10 mg) analgesic agents.
11027904	4	734	Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP pain than control subjects, replicating previous work.
11027904	5	863	Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group.
11027904	6	932	These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a pain-intolerant subset of clinical patients.
11027904	7	1032	Their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively.
11058428	0	0	High-dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury.
11058428	1	70	Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury.
11058428	2	228	In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause.
11058428	3	368	The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition.
11058428	4	527	We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients.
11058428	5	618	Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury.
11058428	6	882	To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy.
11063349	0	0	Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience.
11063349	1	107	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity.
11063349	2	259	METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant.
11063349	3	391	Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses.
11063349	4	447	The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1.
11063349	5	675	Follow-up is 7 to 24 months.
11063349	6	704	RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months].
11063349	7	888	Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients.
11063349	8	933	No relapse of PTLD was observed.
11063349	9	966	Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans.
11063349	10	1142	There were no deaths.
11063349	11	1164	RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one.
11063349	12	1278	RAPA levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients.
11063349	13	1339	CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal.
11063349	14	1430	However, when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.
11077455	0	0	Electro-oculography, electroretinography, visual evoked potentials, and multifocal electroretinography in patients with vigabatrin-attributed visual field constriction.
11077455	1	169	PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual field constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported.
11077455	2	276	The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin-attributed visual field loss, three of whom were reported previously.
11077455	3	464	Six of the patients were no longer receiving vigabatrin.
11077455	4	521	METHODS: The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer.
11077455	5	619	Full visual electrophysiology, including flash electroretinography (ERG), pattern electroretinography, multifocal ERG using the VERIS system, electro-oculography, and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, was undertaken.
11077455	6	846	RESULTS: Seven patients showed marked visual field constriction with some sparing of the temporal visual field.
11077455	7	958	The eighth exhibited concentric constriction.
11077455	8	1004	Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits; two patients had subnormal Arden electro-oculography indices; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave.
11077455	9	1204	However, five patients showed delayed 30-Hz flicker b waves, and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials.
11077455	10	1323	Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level.
11077455	11	1478	CONCLUSION: Marked visual field constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy.
11077455	12	1573	The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when vigabatrin therapy is withdrawn.
11078231	0	0	Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography.
11078231	1	92	Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia.
11078231	2	196	Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.
11078231	3	375	The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine.
11078231	4	494	We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis.
11078231	5	611	All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (variant angina).
11078231	6	713	Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients.
11078231	7	869	DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes.
11078231	8	1006	Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation.
11078231	9	1072	All 7 patients (13.7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy.
11078231	10	1207	These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina.
11078231	11	1321	When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.
11079278	0	0	Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
11079278	1	116	STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects.
11079278	2	382	DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
11079278	3	442	SETTING: Community hospital.
11079278	4	471	PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects.
11079278	5	542	INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol.
11079278	6	622	Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg.
11079278	7	802	Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg.
11079278	8	929	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control.
11079278	9	1078	Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control.
11079278	10	1159	Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control.
11079278	11	1300	No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon.
11079278	12	1399	CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia.
11079278	13	1514	Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.
11099450	0	0	Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy.
11099450	1	70	The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID).
11099450	2	292	We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID.
11099450	3	657	We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs.
11099450	4	943	The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs.
11099450	5	1092	The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias.
11099450	6	1458	Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID.
11099450	7	1600	We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.
11099450	8	1822	The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.
11185967	0	0	Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients.
11185967	1	76	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients.
11185967	2	256	METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation.
11185967	3	408	Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology.
11185967	4	532	Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive.
11185967	5	658	Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers.
11185967	6	963	RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine.
11185967	7	1151	Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse (p < 0.0005).
11185967	8	1293	CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield.
11185967	9	1429	As a result, routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population.
11195262	0	0	Contribution of sodium valproate to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
11195262	1	101	We report the case of a 62-year-old man who was administered sodium valproate (VPA) and who subsequently developed the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
11195262	2	289	He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic convulsions since he was 56 years old.
11195262	3	404	After substituting VPA with zonisamide, the serum sodium level returned to normal.
11195262	4	487	We consider this episode of SIADH to be the result of a combination of factors including a weakness of the central nervous system and the long-term administration of VPA.
11208990	0	0	Association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy.
11208990	1	93	BACKGROUND: In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney.
11208990	2	247	We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR).
11208990	3	411	METHODS: The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system.
11208990	4	613	Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR-induced nephropathy groups.
11208990	5	690	These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-NO synthase.
11208990	6	873	On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis.
11208990	7	956	RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation.
11208990	8	1125	They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05).
11208990	9	1237	Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR-nephropathy group (P < 0.05).
11208990	10	1328	In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR-nephropathy group.
11208990	11	1448	Apoptosis was not detected in controls.
11208990	12	1488	However, in the ADR-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas.
11208990	13	1601	Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages.
11208990	14	1718	Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels.
11208990	15	1864	CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ADR-induced nephrosis.
11226639	0	0	Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate-induced narcosis in rats.
11226639	1	67	Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced narcosis.
11226639	2	185	Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg).
11226639	3	310	Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found.
11226639	4	429	In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis.
11226639	5	529	In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate.
11226639	6	727	Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis.
11226639	7	840	Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.
11230490	0	0	Reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared with conventional doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic breast cancer.
11230490	1	238	PURPOSE: To determine whether Myocet (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin; The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
11230490	2	557	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of Myocet (M) or conventional doxorubicin (A), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
11230490	3	886	Cardiotoxicity was defined by reductions in left-ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans, or congestive heart failure (CHF).
11230490	4	1063	Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective tumor response rates (World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival.
11230490	5	1202	RESULTS: Six percent of MC patients versus 21% (including five cases of CHF) of AC patients developed cardiotoxicity (P =.0002).
11230490	6	1331	Median cumulative doxorubicin dose at onset was more than 2,220 mg/m(2) for MC versus 480 mg/m(2) for AC (P =.0001, hazard ratio, 5.04).
11230490	7	1468	MC patients also experienced less grade 4 neutropenia.
11230490	8	1523	Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable: objective response rates, 43% versus 43%; median time to progression, 5.1% versus 5.5 months; median time to treatment failure, 4.6 versus 4.4 months; and median survival, 19 versus 16 months.
11230490	9	1767	CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for MBC.
11243580	0	0	The role of nitrergic system in lidocaine-induced convulsion in the mouse.
11243580	1	75	The effects of N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor and L-arginine, a NO precursor, were investigated on lidocaine-induced convulsions.
11243580	2	254	In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), L-arginine (300 mg/kg, i.p.), L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg), respectively.
11243580	3	430	Thirty minutes after these injections, all mice received lidocaine (50 mg/kg, i.p.).
11243580	4	515	In the second experiment, four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment, and 30 min after these injections, all mice received a higher dose of lidocaine (80 mg/kg).
11243580	5	705	L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine (50 mg/kg)-induced convulsions.
11243580	6	836	In contrast, the L-arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine (80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced convulsions significantly.
11243580	7	963	These results may suggest that NO is a proconvulsant mediator in lidocaine-induced convulsions.
11245434	0	0	Erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors.
11245434	1	101	The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors.
11245434	2	295	Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration.
11245434	3	442	In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application.
11245434	4	607	Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum.
11245434	5	724	Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se.
11245434	6	802	When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed.
11245434	7	979	In the anemia group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days).
11245434	8	1105	In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days).
11245434	9	1239	These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.
11271907	0	0	Fatal haemorrhagic myocarditis secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy.
11271907	1	70	Haemorrhagic myocarditis is a rare but important complication of cyclophosphamide therapy.
11271907	2	161	Echocardiographic identification of the disorder can be made.
11271907	3	223	We believe that the ultrasound features of this disorder have not been previously reported.
11282081	0	0	Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs.
11282081	1	95	BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current.
11282081	2	250	There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition.
11282081	3	412	METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs.
11282081	4	570	Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments.
11282081	5	692	Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF.
11282081	6	785	RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg.
11282081	7	1048	Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil.
11282081	8	1216	In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005).
11282081	9	1539	Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5).
11282081	10	1681	In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness.
11282081	11	1806	Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade.
11282081	12	1904	Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle.
11282081	13	2071	CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.
11284996	0	0	Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during nitric oxide-induced headache in patients with chronic tension-type headache.
11284996	1	124	It has been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) induced headache in primary headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
11284996	2	280	In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 16 healthy controls.
11284996	3	488	The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache-free days.
11284996	4	608	Blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20 and 60 min after start of infusion.
11284996	5	693	Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls.
11284996	6	892	There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on GTN vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48).
11284996	7	1037	The AUCCGRP recorded on the GTN day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36).
11284996	8	1128	Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the GTN and placebo days (P < 0.05).
11284996	9	1249	The present study indicates that NO-induced immediate headache is not associated with release of CGRP.
11302406	0	0	Fluconazole-induced torsade de pointes.
11302406	1	40	OBJECTIVE: To present a case of fluconazole-associated torsade de pointes (TDP) and discuss fluconazole's role in causing TDP.
11302406	2	167	CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP.
11302406	3	556	The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP.
11302406	4	908	The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents.
11302406	5	1005	In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology.
11302406	6	1291	CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole, even at low doses, may cause prolongation of the QT interval, leading to TDP.
11302406	7	1427	Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
11337188	0	0	Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with oxacillin.
11337188	1	65	A 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, developed renal failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric lesions on his feet.
11337188	2	259	Necrotic blisters were noted on his fingers.
11337188	3	304	Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
11337188	4	377	Oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with corticosteroids.
11337188	5	450	The rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal.
11337188	6	528	Leucocytoclastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement.
11337188	7	682	Etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections, medications, collagen vascular disease and neoplasia.
11337188	8	798	However, in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified.
11337188	9	863	Usually it is a self-limited disorder, but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life-threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complications.
11337188	10	1055	Oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
1141447	0	0	The renal pathology in a case of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus.
1141447	1	69	A case of lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is reported.
1141447	2	127	At necropsy microscopy shoed unique and extensive damage to cells lining the distal nephron.
1141447	3	220	It is suggested that these changes represent a specific toxic effect of lithium, reported here for the first time in man.
11467664	0	0	Cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin.
11467664	1	59	We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride.
11467664	2	182	Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal.
11467664	3	236	An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy.
11467664	4	275	A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis, with portal edema, ductular proliferation, and acute inflammation.
11467664	5	411	Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months.
11467664	6	529	Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin, we believe that this case represents an example of metformin-associated hepatotoxicity, the first such case reported.
11524350	0	0	Systemic toxicity and resuscitation in bupivacaine-, levobupivacaine-, or ropivacaine-infused rats.
11524350	1	100	We compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats.
11524350	2	205	We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics.
11524350	3	301	Bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 mg. kg(-1). min(-1) while electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and arterial pressure were continuously monitored.
11524350	4	491	When asystole was recorded, drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun.
11524350	5	585	Epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg was administered at 1-min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied.
11524350	6	694	Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or =100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min.
11524350	7	811	The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine.
11524350	8	946	The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine, but they were larger than those of bupivacaine.
11524350	9	1132	The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups.
11524350	10	1201	However, a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the Ropivacaine group than in the other groups.
11524350	11	1304	We conclude that the systemic toxicity of levobupivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine-induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or levobupivacaine.
11573852	0	0	Amphotericin B-induced seizures in a patient with AIDS.
11573852	1	56	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin B infusion.
11573852	2	178	CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand mal seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin B, then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time.
11573852	3	416	The patients concurrent medications included didanosine, hydroxyzine, promethazine, hydrocortisone, and prochlorperazine.
11573852	4	538	Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam, the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin B administration.
11573852	5	667	DISCUSSION: AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis, both of which the patient had, can potentially cause seizures.
11573852	6	776	The patient had a history of alcohol abuse; alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures.
11573852	7	882	Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures.
11573852	8	937	However, these other potential causes of seizure were ruled out.
11573852	9	1002	The time course of events suggested that amphotericin B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient.
11573852	10	1110	CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures.
11573852	11	1186	To date, only three cases of seizures associated with amphotericin B have been reported in the literature, but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect.
11583940	0	0	Sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin-free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
11583940	1	107	Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have been available for almost 20 years.
11583940	2	209	Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression, they are associated with acute and chronic nephrotoxicity.
11583940	3	370	Acute nephrotoxicity, which occurs in the early period after transplantation, leads to a higher rate of dialysis, and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft loss.
11583940	4	548	Acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases.
11583940	5	667	Two recently available immunosuppressive agents, mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus (rapamycin), have no nephrotoxicity.
11583940	6	789	The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy.
11583940	7	919	This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients.
11694026	0	0	Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema.
11694026	1	96	Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nimesulide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous, respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
11694026	2	293	In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema.
11694026	3	498	Furthermore, we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nimesulide.
11694026	4	628	A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema.
11694026	5	794	A total of 75/829 (9.4%) patients experienced reactions to nimesulide or paracetamol.
11694026	6	880	Of the 715 patients tested with nimesulide 62 (8.6%) showed a positive test, while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol, 13 (9.6%) did not tolerate this drug.
11694026	7	1062	Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8% of subjects with an history of NSAID-induced urticaria/angioedema or angioedema alone (with or without chronic urticaria) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs.
11694026	8	1310	Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria/angioedema caused by NSAIDs.
11694026	9	1465	However, the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and, above all, by a history of NSAID-induced angioedema.
11704023	0	0	Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24-hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma.
11704023	1	139	PURPOSE: Topical beta-blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with glaucoma.
11704023	2	243	Therapy results in systemic absorption, however, the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified.
11704023	3	372	DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate.
11704023	4	683	METHODS: Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening).
11704023	5	1077	On the 13th day of each period, heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical, ambulant 24-hour period.
11704023	6	1189	RESULTS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan reduced the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo (P < or = .001), and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime (-7.5% change in mean heart rate, -5.7 beats/min).
11704023	7	1423	Timolol gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24-hour heart rate, compared with timolol solution.
11704023	8	1554	During the night, the mean 12-hour heart rate on placebo and timolol gellan were both significantly less than on timolol solution; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant (P = .01).
11704023	9	1780	CONCLUSIONS: Both timolol solution and timolol gellan decrease the mean 24-hour heart rate compared with placebo.
11704023	10	1894	This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period.
11704023	11	1962	These data quantify the modest bradycardia associated with ophthalmic beta-blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for glaucoma.
11704023	12	2110	Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial, reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences.
11705128	0	0	Management strategies for ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis C: clinical and economic implications.
11705128	1	130	OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC).
11705128	2	381	Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia (RIHA).
11705128	3	502	The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting.
11705128	4	651	METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA.
11705128	5	772	Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA.
11705128	6	850	Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses.
11705128	7	904	RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy.
11705128	8	1057	The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage.
11705128	9	1158	We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692).
11705128	10	1327	The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317.
11705128	11	1400	In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459.
11705128	12	1471	CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs.
11705128	13	1586	Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population.
11705128	14	1693	Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.
11752998	0	0	Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of adenosine in humans.
11752998	1	108	BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation.
11752998	2	434	The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity.
11752998	3	634	METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg.
11752998	4	944	Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined.
11752998	5	1164	RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h.
11752998	6	1372	In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h).
11752998	7	1455	CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection.
11752998	8	1644	The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.
11827497	0	0	Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
11827497	1	48	BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli.
11827497	2	189	Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes.
11827497	3	296	OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed.
11827497	4	451	DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
11827497	5	486	SETTING: Three large urban hospitals (with active cardiovascular surgery programs).
11827497	6	570	PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications.
11827497	7	734	MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of heparin-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes.
11827497	8	889	RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications.
11827497	9	1111	Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with pulmonary emboli) or arterial (4 patients) or both.
11827497	10	1210	Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation.
11827497	11	1294	On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic heparin, which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after heparin re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L).
11827497	12	1553	Results of serologic tests for heparin-induced antibodies were positive in all patients.
11827497	13	1642	Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, warfarin (11 patients).
11827497	14	1829	Three patients died.
11827497	15	1850	CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized.
11827497	16	1944	To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not heparin, should be initiated.
11838826	0	0	Treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children.
11838826	1	89	BACKGROUND: Risperidone, a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children.
11838826	2	255	Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature.
11838826	3	433	These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth.
11838826	4	564	We report the successful treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth.
11838826	5	668	METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline.
11838826	6	805	RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar disorder or psychoses, with risperidone-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with cabergoline (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week).
11838826	7	1113	When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects (mean 11.2 +/- 10.9 ng/mL), the cabergoline dose was reduced to 1 mg/week in three of four subjects.
11838826	8	1274	The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523.5 +/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788.5 +/- 162.5 days.
11838826	9	1422	Cabergoline was well tolerated without adverse effects.
11838826	10	1478	CONCLUSIONS: Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth; however, further research is needed.
11847945	0	0	Acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to isoflurane.
11847945	1	58	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane.
11847945	2	179	CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia.
11847945	3	346	There was no evidence for viral, autoimmune, or metabolic causes of hepatitis.
11847945	4	425	No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia.
11847945	5	495	The alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U/L and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg/dL.
11847945	6	627	There was slow improvement over 4 months.
11847945	7	669	Accidental reexposure by the patient to dipyrone was uneventful.
11847945	8	734	DISCUSSION: The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis, which has a significant mortality rate.
11847945	9	866	CONCLUSIONS: Isoflurane, a common anesthetic agent, can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis.
11858397	0	0	Torsade de pointes induced by metoclopramide in an elderly woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block.
11858397	1	117	There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired long QT syndrome and torsade de pointes.
11858397	2	214	However, the torsadogenic potential of metoclopramide, a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug, has not been reported in the literature, despite its chemical similarity to procainamide.
11858397	3	407	We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete left bundle branch block who developed torsade de pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide.
11858397	4	585	This patient also developed torsade de pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously.
11858397	5	691	These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs.
11858397	6	813	This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade de pointes clinically.
11858397	7	905	Metoclopramide should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of torsade de pointes.
11860278	0	0	Dopamine D2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs.
11860278	1	107	Dopamine (DA), through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system.
11860278	2	251	Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular level.
11860278	3	377	In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy-induced neuronal cell death.
11860278	4	500	Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine.
11860278	5	627	We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (KA), a potent glutamate agonist.
11860278	6	735	Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity.
11860278	7	879	However, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to KA.
11860278	8	1011	Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine.
11860278	9	1115	Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy-induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.
11860495	0	0	Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-amnesic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats.
11860495	1	148	Pregnenolone sulphate (PREGS) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory-enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies, with particular importance in the ageing process.
11860495	2	351	The mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems.
11860495	3	499	This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs).
11860495	4	698	Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands.
11860495	5	789	To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and/or GABA(A)R function.
11860495	6	986	The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on GABA(A)Rs and NMDARs).
11860495	7	1312	The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced amnesia.
11860495	8	1456	Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of scopolamine.
11860495	9	1526	The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS.
11860495	10	1772	Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced amnesia.
11860495	11	1965	These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive steroids.
11861791	0	0	Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin-induced heart failure.
11861791	1	107	Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by oxidant-mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress.
11861791	2	316	Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic.
11861791	3	466	Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
11861791	4	566	Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34, we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX.
11861791	5	802	PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1-/- mice received a single injection of DOX (25 mg/kg i.p).
11861791	6	882	Five days after DOX administration, left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP-1+/+ mice, but only to a smaller extent in PARP-1-/- ones.
11861791	7	1042	Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with PJ34 or vehicle.
11861791	8	1122	Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals.
11861791	9	1230	In addition PJ34 significantly reduced the DOX-induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart.
11861791	10	1411	Thus, PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX.
11861791	11	1475	PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the DOX treatment.
11868798	0	0	Spironolactone: is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B-related hypokalemia in cancer patients?
11868798	1	112	OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage.
11868798	2	237	Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB.
11868798	3	401	Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB.
11868798	4	467	This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.
11868798	5	633	METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection.
11868798	6	867	RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027).
11868798	7	1024	Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022).
11868798	8	1198	Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040).
11868798	9	1346	CONCLUSION: This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.
11890511	0	0	Erectile dysfunction occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat.
11890511	1	75	Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni- and bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain.
11890511	2	221	Behavioral apomorphine-induced penile erections were reduced (5/8) and increased (3/8) in uni- and bilateral lesioned animals.
11890511	3	348	Intracavernous pressures, following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, decreased in lesioned animals.
11890511	4	462	Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology.
11890511	5	523	Concentration of dopamine and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats.
11890511	6	635	Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with erectile dysfunction in rats and may serve as a model to study erectile dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.
11900788	0	0	Nicotine potentiation of morphine-induced catalepsy in mice.
11900788	1	61	In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated.
11900788	2	168	Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy.
11900788	3	230	The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine.
11900788	4	284	Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine.
11900788	5	448	Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine.
11900788	6	583	Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine.
11900788	7	757	It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.
11912119	0	0	Force overflow and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
11912119	1	72	We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID).
11912119	2	255	We studied two groups of Parkinson's disease patients with (Parkinson's disease + LID, n = 23) and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Parkinson's disease - LID, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls.
11912119	3	462	The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa.
11912119	4	615	A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in Parkinson's disease + LID only.
11912119	5	705	In Parkinson's disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05).
11912119	6	857	An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition.
11912119	7	1015	In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson's disease - LID.
11912119	8	1087	Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in Parkinson's disease + LID than in Parkinson's disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups.
11912119	9	1279	Severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01).
11912119	10	1403	No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication.
11912119	11	1525	Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations.
11912119	12	1601	A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON-drug condition.
11912119	13	1708	We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.
11999899	0	0	Behavioral effects of MK-801 on reserpine-treated mice.
11999899	1	56	The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by reserpine treatments.
11999899	2	235	This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage.
11999899	3	397	Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia.
11999899	4	605	Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease.
11999899	5	702	MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine.
11999899	6	867	However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine-treated mice.
11999899	7	962	Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice.
11999899	8	1132	On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice.
11999899	9	1229	MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine.
11999899	10	1321	Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine.
11999899	11	1604	These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs.
11999899	12	1802	The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and tremor according to the employed model.
12013711	0	0	Risperidone-associated, benign transient visual disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of LSD abuse.
12013711	1	121	Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone.
12013711	2	296	They both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances, which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone.
12013711	3	434	This imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior LSD consumption.
12013711	4	550	Risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off.
12013711	5	639	During a six-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of visual disturbances.
12013711	6	724	This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign, short-term and self-limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of risperidone or interfere with treatment.
12013711	7	895	Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution.
12042105	0	0	Topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis.
12042105	1	36	Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory seizures.
12042105	2	193	Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause metabolic acidosis in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase.
12042105	3	329	In addition, a distal tubular acidification defect may result, thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH. These factors can lead to the development of calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis.
12042105	4	529	We report the first two cases of topiramate-induced nephrolithiasis in the urologic literature.
12091028	0	0	Ketamine in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture).
12091028	1	75	A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates.
12091028	2	389	Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only.
12091028	3	583	After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective.
12091028	4	784	Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate.
12091028	5	871	Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations.
12091028	6	1102	Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia.
12091028	7	1198	An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate.
12091028	8	1391	Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.
12093990	0	0	Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children.
12093990	1	93	BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host.
12093990	2	196	The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported.
12093990	3	402	There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies.
12093990	4	619	Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series.
12093990	5	742	Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir.
12093990	6	807	Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro.
12093990	7	962	Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses.
12093990	8	1219	The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia.
12093990	9	1302	The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity.
12093990	10	1440	OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature.
12093990	11	1610	DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease.
12093990	12	1765	Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively.
12093990	13	1877	The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease.
12093990	14	1986	An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome.
12093990	15	2101	The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant.
12093990	16	2167	Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol.
12093990	17	2239	RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia.
12093990	18	2466	The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease.
12093990	19	2519	Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated.
12093990	20	2569	Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia.
12093990	21	2660	DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency.
12093990	22	2911	Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection.
12093990	23	3128	Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response.
12093990	24	3329	CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered.
12093990	25	3437	The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible.
12093990	26	3604	Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.
12101159	0	0	Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium.
12101159	1	109	A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol.
12101159	2	238	He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids.
12101159	3	375	Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures.
12101159	4	455	The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic.
12101159	5	574	He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine).
12101159	6	668	He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours.
12101159	7	743	This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole.
12101159	8	902	It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose.
12101159	9	985	The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.
12109865	0	0	Low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves.
12109865	1	89	BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy.
12109865	2	303	Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients.
12109865	3	382	Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves.
12109865	4	572	HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice.
12109865	5	754	METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed.
12109865	6	885	RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports.
12109865	7	940	None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective.
12109865	8	1006	Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete.
12109865	9	1065	After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10).
12109865	10	1356	The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups).
12109865	11	1578	CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH.
12109865	12	1685	Data on mid- and long-term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse.
12109865	13	1762	Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves.
12139551	0	0	Cardiac arrest after intravenous metoclopramide - a case of five repeated injections of metoclopramide causing five episodes of cardiac arrest.
12139551	1	144	We describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by asystole repeatedly.
12139551	2	261	The patient received metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. five times during 48 h.
12139551	3	332	After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately (within s) followed by asystole.
12139551	4	518	The asystole lasted 15-30 s on four occasions, on one occasion it lasted 2 min.
12139551	5	598	The patient received atropine 0.5-1 mg and chest compressions, before sinus rhythm again took over.
12139551	6	698	We interpret this as episodes of cardiac arrest caused by metoclopramide.
12139551	7	772	The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of dopamine infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction.
12180796	0	0	Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline, vasodilators.
12180796	1	223	Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1).
12180796	2	478	Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline.
12180796	3	628	Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-fenoldopam-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI.
12180796	4	936	These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models.
12180796	5	1126	On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.
12231232	0	0	The striatum as a target for anti-rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR1, but not an agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors.
12231232	1	141	The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 (mGluR1) and group II mGluRs, localized in the striatum, are involved in antiparkinsonian-like effects in rats.
12231232	2	334	Haloperidol (1 mg/kg ip) induced parkinsonian-like muscle rigidity, measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint. (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA; 0.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist, or (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (2R,4R-APDC; 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl), a selective group II agonist, was injected bilaterally into the striatum of haloperidol-treated animals.
12231232	3	821	AIDA in doses of 7.5-15 microg/0.5 microl diminished the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity.
12231232	4	915	In contrast, 2R,4R-APDC injections were ineffective.
12231232	5	968	The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR1, but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs, may ameliorate parkinsonian muscle rigidity.
12448656	0	0	A phase II study of thalidomide in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
12448656	1	77	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy.
12448656	2	306	PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule.
12448656	3	429	Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54.
12448656	4	519	Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3.
12448656	5	626	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients.
12448656	6	711	RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months.
12448656	7	926	Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level.
12448656	8	1045	Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy.
12448656	9	1105	CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma.
12448656	10	1215	Administration of doses over 800 mg/day was difficult to achieve in this patient population, however lower doses were practical.
12448656	11	1344	The dose-response relationship, if any, of thalidomide for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.
12452237	0	0	Can lidocaine reduce succinylcholine induced postoperative myalgia?
12452237	1	68	This study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery.
12452237	2	261	One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner.
12452237	3	386	Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, lidocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1).
12452237	4	604	Morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry.
12452237	5	759	Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (Group PS, LS) or rocuronium (Group PR) for tracheal intubation.
12452237	6	907	Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered.
12452237	7	1098	The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions.
12452237	8	1182	Twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management.
12452237	9	1378	The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS (p < 0.001).
12452237	10	1564	At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05).
12452237	11	1657	A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation.
12452237	12	1762	The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups.
12452237	13	1875	In conclusion, where succinylcholine is used, lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia.
12481039	0	0	Reduced sodium channel density, altered voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2-subunits.
12481039	1	165	Sodium channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems.
12481039	2	287	We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo.
12481039	3	434	Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2(-/-) neurons.
12481039	4	582	The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons.
12481039	5	773	The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels.
12481039	6	1009	In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests.
12481039	7	1378	Our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.
12549952	0	0	Acute liver failure with concurrent bupropion and carbimazole therapy.
12549952	1	71	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal liver failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole.
12549952	2	192	CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years.
12549952	3	338	He received a 10-day course of bupropion as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation.
12549952	4	443	He developed acute liver failure with rapid deterioration of renal function.
12549952	5	520	Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific drug-induced acute liver injury.
12549952	6	597	His condition was further complicated by sepsis and coagulopathy.
12549952	7	663	Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms.
12549952	8	715	The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale.
12549952	9	837	DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion, this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute liver failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole.
12549952	10	1094	CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute liver insult induced by bupropion given concurrently with other hepatotoxic drugs.
1255900	0	0	Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation: a case report.
1255900	1	87	The etiology of pyeloureteritis cystica has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation.
1255900	2	191	A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography.
1255900	3	356	There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent infection in this patient.
1255900	4	432	The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation.
1255900	5	594	The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true pyeloureteritis cystica and submucosal hemorrhage.
12571256	0	0	Nephrotoxic effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography.
12571256	1	66	BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephropathy.
12571256	2	142	Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain.
12571256	3	267	METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol.
12571256	4	522	The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography.
12571256	5	688	The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angiography.
12571256	6	820	Other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7.
12571256	7	1030	RESULTS: The creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodixanol.
12571256	8	1133	From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]).
12571256	9	1432	Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]).
12571256	10	1764	No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did.
12571256	11	1899	The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).
12571256	12	2214	CONCLUSIONS: Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.
12600698	0	0	Protective effect of edaravone against streptomycin-induced vestibulotoxicity in the guinea pig.
12600698	1	97	This study investigated alleviation of streptomycin-induced vestibulotoxicity by edaravone in guinea pigs.
12600698	2	204	Edaravone, a free radical scavenger, has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral infarction.
12600698	3	345	Streptomycin was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h, and edaravone (n=8) or saline (n=6) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days.
12600698	4	508	We observed horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function.
12600698	5	605	Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with edaravone.
12600698	6	705	These results suggest that edaravone suppresses streptomycin-induced vestibulotoxicity.
12691807	0	0	Levodopa-induced oromandibular dystonia in progressive supranuclear palsy.
12691807	1	75	Levodopa-induced dyskinesias have been reported in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.
12691807	2	175	Cranial dystonias are rare in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
12691807	3	257	In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible levodopa-induced Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) in a PSP patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of PSP, and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology.
12734532	0	0	Case report: Dexatrim (Phenylpropanolamine) as a cause of myocardial infarction.
12734532	1	81	Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a sympathetic amine used in over-the-counter cold remedies and weight-control preparations worldwide.
12734532	2	212	Its use has been associated with hypertensive episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger women.
12734532	3	309	Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial injury, especially when overdose is involved.
12734532	4	416	We report here the first case of Dexatrim (PPA)-induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control.
12734532	5	565	In addition, we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial injury that have been reported so far.
12734532	6	671	Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of PPA, even at doses generally considered to be safe.
12739036	0	0	Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus.
12739036	1	93	We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy.
12739036	2	203	Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide.
12739036	3	376	Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ) was started because of arthralgia.
12739036	4	452	At the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted.
12739036	5	529	Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids.
12739036	6	596	The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy.
12739036	7	702	Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l.
12739036	8	770	The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis.
12739036	9	851	Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy.
12739036	10	959	As it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped.
12739036	11	1028	Discriminating between primary SLE-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients.
12745515	0	0	Seizure associated with sleep deprivation and sustained-release bupropion.
12745515	1	75	This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained-release bupropion use and sleep deprivation.
12745515	2	195	The subject, a 31-year-old female smoker, was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained-release bupropion as an active control.
12745515	3	398	After 5 weeks of bupropion use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence.
12745515	4	562	The patient had no other risk factors for seizures.

12760988	0	0	Postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine: no evidence for an inflammatory origin.
12760988	1	85	A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative myalgia.
12760988	2	164	The pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence.
12760988	3	280	We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this myalgia.
12760988	4	387	The incidence and severity of succinylcholine-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each).
12760988	5	564	Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant).
12760988	6	860	At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia (not significant).
12760988	7	957	In addition, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline.
12760988	8	1092	We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported myalgia; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of IL-6 was found.
12760988	9	1253	In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine-associated myalgia.
12760988	10	1355	IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine-induced postoperative myalgia.
12760988	11	1536	Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation.
12760988	12	1692	Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succinylcholine.
12842176	0	0	Effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity.
12842176	1	123	Oral administration of lindane (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA-d) in rat brain and liver.
12842176	2	435	A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days.
12842176	3	630	As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain.
12842176	4	804	Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes.
12842176	5	974	In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1/2B2, 1A1/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively.
12842176	6	1274	Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions.
12842176	7	1671	Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.
12851669	0	0	Absolute and attributable risk of venous thromboembolism in women on combined cyproterone acetate and ethinylestradiol.
12851669	1	120	OBJECTIVE: To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among women on cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (CPA/EE), and among women on combined oral contraceptives (COCs).
12851669	2	321	METHODS: From the Danish National Register of Patients (NRP), 1996 to 1998, the records of 1.1 million Danish women, ages 15 to 44 years, were searched for evidence of VTE.
12851669	3	494	COC use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires.
12851669	4	549	Sales statistics of COCs and CPA/EE were provided through Danish Drug Statistics.
12851669	5	631	RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs.
12851669	6	728	Of these women, 67 were on levonorgestrel-containing COCs.
12851669	7	787	Eleven were on CPA/EE.
12851669	8	810	The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs, 4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel-containing COCs, and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA/EE.
12851669	9	1088	CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the absolute risk of VTE among Danish women on COCs is similar to that among women taking CPA/EE.
12852481	0	0	Comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in rats using selected dosing paradigms.
12852481	1	114	BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis.
12852481	2	327	Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ.
12852481	3	555	Teratology 4:15-24, 1971).
12852481	4	582	There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17.
12852481	5	668	Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.
12852481	6	1096	METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats.
12852481	7	1342	Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally.
12852481	8	1410	RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low-incidence malformations.
12852481	9	1746	In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10.
12852481	10	1816	VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11.
12852481	11	1865	In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups.
12852481	12	2004	CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats.
12852481	13	2184	Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17).
12852481	14	2322	It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses.
1286498	0	0	Reversal of central benzodiazepine effects by flumazenil after intravenous conscious sedation with diazepam and opioids: report of a double-blind multicenter study.
1286498	1	165	The Flumazenil in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with Diazepam Multicenter Study Group II.
1286498	2	256	The efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, were assessed in a double-blind multicenter study.
1286498	3	379	Flumazenil (mean dose, 0.76 mg) or placebo (mean dose, 8.9 ml) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients, respectively, who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or morphine) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures.
1286498	4	724	The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flumazenil and 64 patients given placebo.
1286498	5	836	After 5 minutes, 80/115 (70%) flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 21/63 (33%) placebo-treated patients, were completely awake and alert, as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale.
1286498	6	1067	Ninety-five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5-minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180-minute assessment period.
1286498	7	1239	Flumazenil-treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger-to-Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5-minute assessment.
1286498	8	1391	Flumazenil was well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported.
1286498	9	1464	Thirty-nine (30%) of flumazenil-treated patients, compared with 17 (25%) of placebo-treated patients had one or more drug-related adverse experiences.
1286498	10	1615	The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group.
1286498	11	1753	Flumazenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids.
12907924	0	0	Methylphenidate-induced obsessive-compulsive symptoms in an elderly man.
12907924	1	73	An 82-year-old man with treatment-resistant depression and early Alzheimer's disease was started on methylphenidate.
12907924	2	190	Significant obsessive-compulsive behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine.
12907924	3	323	The patient had no prior psychiatric history, but he had a sister with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
12907924	4	425	It appears that methylphenidate precipitated the patient's pathological behavior.
12911170	0	0	Ciprofloxacin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
12911170	1	84	Ciprofloxacin has been associated with several side effects including interstitial nephritis and hemolytic anemia.
12911170	2	199	The combination of both side effects is extremely rare.
12911170	3	255	In this report, we describe a case of ciprofloxacin-induced interstitial nephritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
12911170	4	371	Hemolytic anemia improved after stopping the drug and initiation of steroid therapy.
12911170	5	456	Unfortunately, acute interstitial nephritis was irreversible and the patient developed end-stage renal disease.
1300436	0	0	Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy.
1300436	1	73	The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital.
1300436	2	480	In addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material.
1300436	3	628	The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters).
1300436	4	679	Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml.
1300436	5	815	Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l).
1300436	6	1083	Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group.
1300436	7	1162	Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.

133615	2	50	Thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors: summary report of a ten-year study.
133615	3	224	During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters.
133615	4	401	Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups.
133615	5	579	Severe complications developed in four patients.
133615	6	628	All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting "hypercoagulability" before initiation of therapy.
133615	7	742	Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy.
133615	8	885	One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained.
133615	9	1024	One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy.
133615	10	1160	The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy.
133615	11	1257	All four patients were of the A or AB blood group.
133615	12	1308	Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen.
133615	13	1442	It appears from these data that hematologic work-ups may be useful in women who are about to start long-term oral contraceptive therapy.
1355091	0	0	Orthostatic hypotension occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic prazosin-pretreated conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1.
1355091	1	148	Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2.
1355091	2	365	Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.).
1355091	3	543	Orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period.
1355091	4	677	The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP).
1355091	5	805	However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3.
1355091	6	990	Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.
1355091	7	1109	MAP in conscious SHR after chronic prazosin treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8).
1355091	8	1212	Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.).
1355091	9	1365	Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. 4.
1355091	10	1577	The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment.
1355091	11	1882	Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4).
1355091	12	2034	On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment.
1355091	13	2238	Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
1415380	0	0	Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine.
1415380	1	64	Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature.
1415380	2	217	We describe a 5th case.
1415380	3	241	The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine.
1415380	4	355	Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole.
1415380	5	441	The patients have all regained some degree of renal function.
1415380	6	503	However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement.
1415380	7	622	Quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized.
1415380	8	714	It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.
1423339	0	0	Amnestic syndrome associated with propranolol toxicity: a case report.
1423339	1	71	An elderly woman developed an Alzheimer-like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxicity.
1423339	2	171	Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities.
1423339	3	292	There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug toxicity can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain.
1445986	0	0	Cefotetan-induced immune hemolytic anemia.
1445986	1	43	Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins.
1445986	2	202	We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan.
1445986	3	284	Cefotetan-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells.
1445986	4	404	The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies.
1445986	5	555	These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis, are consistent with drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms.
1445986	6	786	This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins.
14633084	0	0	Use of dexamethasone with mesna for the prevention of ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
14633084	1	95	AIM: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide (IFS).
14633084	2	191	In the study presented here, we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS-induced HC.
14633084	3	325	METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of IFS.
14633084	4	485	One, two or three doses of mesna were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus mesna.
14633084	5	591	Cystitis was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis.
14633084	6	721	RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively.
14633084	7	907	In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by IFS.
14633084	8	1000	Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of mesna was more efficient than three doses of mesna alone when evaluated microscopically.
14633084	9	1154	CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS-induced HC.
14633084	10	1248	However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent HC.
14648024	0	0	All- trans-retinoic acid-induced erythema nodosum in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
14648024	1	97	Erythema nodosum associated with all- trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is very rare.
14648024	2	215	We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema nodosum during ATRA therapy.
14648024	3	310	Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy.
14648024	4	457	The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum.
14648024	5	535	All patients received short course of steroids.
14648024	6	583	Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely.
14648024	7	649	All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA.
14648024	8	718	ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients.
14648024	9	800	Short-term use of steroid is very effective in ATRA-induced erythema nodosum.
14704468	0	0	Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with valproate or clonazepam in amygdala-kindled rats.
14704468	1	145	Loreclezole (5 mg/kg) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala-kindled rats, reducing both seizure and afterdischarge durations.
14704468	2	285	The combinations of loreclezole (2.5 mg/kg) with valproate, clonazepam, or carbamazepine (applied at their subprotective doses) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test.
14704468	3	461	However, only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature.
14704468	4	540	Among several chemoconvulsants, bicuculline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid and BAY k-8644 (the opener of L-type calcium channels) reversed the protective activity of loreclezole alone and its combination with valproate.
14704468	5	755	On the other hand, bicuculline, aminophylline and BAY k-8644 inhibited the anticonvulsive action of loreclezole combined with clonazepam.
14704468	6	893	The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of loreclezole and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L-type of calcium channels.
14736955	0	0	Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin nephrosis.
14736955	1	93	BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin induces a self-perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular and late-onset tubular lesions in rats.
14736955	2	231	We investigated the potential role of mitochondrial injury in the onset of these lesions.
14736955	3	321	METHODS: Rats were treated with intravenous doxorubicin (1 mg kg(-1) week(-1)) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ('short-term') or 30 weeks ('long-term') following the last dose.
14736955	4	512	Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia.
14736955	5	593	All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age.
14736955	6	634	Glomerular and tubular injury was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components.
14736955	7	756	Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as superoxide production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion.
14736955	8	903	RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant glomerular and tubular lesions, depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased citrate synthase activity.
14736955	9	1111	In addition, expression of the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased.
14736955	10	1215	In 'short-term' rats, there were fewer tubular lesions, but similar numbers of glomerular lesions activity.
14736955	11	1323	Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I.
14736955	12	1538	Injury was positively correlated with superoxide production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes.
14736955	13	1674	Kidneys from the 'long-term' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in 'short-term' animals and these were not observed in the other groups.
14736955	14	1815	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of superoxide in doxorubicin-induced renal lesions.
14742097	0	0	A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ephedrine for SSRI-induced female sexual dysfunction.
14742097	1	107	The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women, has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.
14742097	2	345	Nineteen sexually dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of ephedrine (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction.
14742097	3	640	Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity/pleasure on 50 mg ephedrine 1-hr prior to sexual activity, significant improvements in these measures, as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo.
14742097	4	927	These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo-controlled trials for this condition.
14745746	0	0	Does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition?
14745746	1	107	A pilot study.
14745746	2	122	This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition.
14745746	3	209	Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without breast cancer (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures.
14745746	4	414	Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups.
14745746	5	642	Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity.
14745746	6	761	The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer.
14745746	7	911	Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women.
14745746	8	1073	In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.
14975762	0	0	Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo.
14975762	1	69	Doxorubicin is an anti-tumor agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis.
14975762	2	191	Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes.
14975762	3	346	However, the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is unknown.
14975762	4	436	Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment.
14975762	5	545	Compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin.
14975762	6	724	Doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice.
14975762	7	816	Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family.
14975762	8	941	These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.
14982270	0	0	Methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice.
14982270	1	42	Methimazole is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent.
14982270	2	119	A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism.
14982270	3	281	The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications.
14982270	4	402	When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction.
14982270	5	561	Methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed.
14982270	6	645	Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole.
14982270	7	770	In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice.
14982270	8	887	Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.
15042318	0	0	Atrial fibrillation following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B-cell gastric lymphoma in a patient with myotonic dystrophy (Steinert's disease).
15042318	1	155	The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in the same patient.
15042318	2	420	Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy.
15042318	3	534	The cardiac toxicity intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.
1504402	0	0	Hypersensitivity immune reaction as a mechanism for dilevalol-associated hepatitis.
1504402	1	84	OBJECTIVE: To assess lymphocyte reactivity to dilevalol and to serum containing putative ex vivo dilevalol antigens or metabolites in a case of dilevalol-induced liver injury.
1504402	2	260	PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with a clinical diagnosis of dilevalol-induced liver injury.
1504402	3	350	METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of dilevalol and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after dilevalol intake.
1504402	4	559	A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject.
1504402	5	633	RESULTS: No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of dilevalol solutions.
1504402	6	773	A significant proliferative response to serum collected after dilevalol intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake.
1504402	7	980	No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions.
1504402	8	1084	CONCLUSIONS: The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo-prepared dilevalol antigens, suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in dilevalol-induced liver injury.
15075188	0	0	Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats.
15075188	1	130	Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema.
15075188	2	213	However, the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains undefined.
15075188	3	302	We hypothesized that epithelial Na channel (ENaC) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention.
15075188	4	429	An experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle.
15075188	5	572	After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites.
15075188	6	709	The protein abundance of alpha-ENaC and beta-ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and in the inner medulla (IM) but was not altered in the cortex. gamma-ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex, ISOM, and IM.
15075188	7	950	Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments.
15075188	8	1257	Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits.
15075188	9	1492	In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased.
15075188	10	1679	Moreover, the abundance of the alpha(1)-subunit of the Na-K-ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM, but it remained unchanged in the IM.
15075188	11	1821	In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome.
15075188	12	2082	The decreased abundance of NHE3, BSC-1, TSC, and Na-K-ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion.
15096016	0	0	Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?
15096016	1	53	A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985.
15096016	2	209	Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community.
15096016	3	338	Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates.
15096016	4	540	Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success.
15096016	5	596	According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations.
15096016	6	779	Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias.
15096016	7	931	Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the "freezing" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time.
15096016	8	1091	Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.
15266215	0	0	Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arthritis.
15266215	1	182	There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
15266215	2	383	We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib, a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials.
15266215	3	600	The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial thrombotic) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration.
15266215	4	994	The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) aspirin (n = 1051) and nonusers of aspirin (n = 6883).
15266215	5	1168	Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo.
15266215	6	1278	The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose.
15266215	7	1359	Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; valdecoxib, 1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%).
15266215	8	1525	The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses.
15266215	9	1634	Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials.
15266362	0	0	Hypersensitivity myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart.
15266362	1	77	The present report describes a case of eosinophilic myocarditis complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
15266362	2	183	The 47-year-old female patient, known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was admitted with biventricular failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation.
15266362	3	412	On transthoracic echocardiogram, she had moderate left ventricular dysfunction with regional variability and moderate mitral regurgitation.
15266362	4	552	The recipient's heart showed the features of apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocarditis with abundant eosinophils.
15266362	5	675	Myocarditis is rare and eosinophilic myocarditis is rarer.
15266362	6	734	It is likely that the hypersensitivity (eosinophilic) myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy.
15266362	7	844	Eosinophilic myocarditis has been reported with an incidence of 2.4% to 7.2% in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy.
15276120	0	0	Time trends in warfarin-associated hemorrhage.
15276120	1	47	The annual incidence of warfarin-related bleeding at Brigham and Women's Hospital increased from 0.97/1,000 patient admissions in the first time period (January 1995 to October 1998) to 1.19/1,000 patient admissions in the second time period (November 1998 to August 2002) of this study.
15276120	2	335	The proportion of patients with major and intracranial bleeding increased from 20.2% and 1.9%, respectively, in the first time period, to 33.3% and 7.8%, respectively, in the second.
1535072	0	0	Yohimbine treatment of sexual side effects induced by serotonin reuptake blockers.
1535072	1	83	BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male impotence.
1535072	2	234	A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomipramine.
1535072	3	341	This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.
1535072	4	454	METHOD: Six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, anxiety, or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial.
1535072	5	716	Various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient.
1535072	6	799	RESULTS: Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yohimbine.
1535072	7	897	One patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effects.
1535072	8	983	Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating, increased anxiety, and a wound-up feeling in some patients.
1535072	9	1098	CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.
1535072	10	1257	Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication.
1545575	0	0	Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation.
1545575	1	63	Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation.
1545575	2	209	As standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation.
1545575	3	388	In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis.
1545575	4	612	Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis, 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis.
1545575	5	702	In contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks.
1545575	6	882	Because of this suboptimal result, we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.
15517007	0	0	Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.
15517007	1	214	Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases.
15517007	2	363	Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials.
15517007	3	465	The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials.
15517007	4	538	However, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed.
15517007	5	636	This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections.
15517007	6	754	The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low.
15517007	7	811	However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients.
15517007	8	1005	In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine.
15517007	9	1202	The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients.
15517007	10	1424	A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation.
15531665	0	0	Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?
15531665	1	89	BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro.
15531665	2	236	These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis.
15531665	3	360	OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease.
15531665	4	481	DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline.
15531665	5	722	Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements.
15531665	6	1256	Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01).
15531665	7	1438	When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints.
15531665	8	1588	Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline.
15531665	9	1701	CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.
15565293	0	0	Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy.
15565293	1	107	PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT).
15565293	2	262	Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis.
15565293	3	337	A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision.
15565293	4	465	However, early on, when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss.
15565293	5	607	METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol (EMB)-induced optic neuropathy of short-, intermediate-, and long-term visual deficits were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination.
15565293	6	890	In addition, OCT (OCT 3000, Humphrey-Zeiss, Dublin, CA) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) analysis protocol.
15565293	7	1051	OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL.
15565293	8	1145	RESULTS: The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT, n=661.
15565293	9	1280	In all subjects with history of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual deficits, 68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual deficits, 90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm.
15565293	10	1668	There was a combined mean loss of 46% of fibers from the superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants in the (six) eyes of all three subjects (mean average thickness of 55+/-29 microm).
15565293	11	1849	In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant.
15565293	12	2029	CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers.
15565293	13	2168	This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuropathies.
15565293	14	2377	OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuropathies.
15565293	15	2456	Additionally, in terms of management of EMB-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.
15579441	0	0	Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and/or glomerular hypertension.
15579441	1	74	Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available.
15579441	2	213	In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat.
15579441	3	436	We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney.
15579441	4	541	With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model.
15579441	5	729	Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.
15579441	6	1065	The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models.
15579441	7	1176	Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model.
15579441	8	1387	We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.
15580403	0	0	Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.
15580403	1	146	BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin.
15580403	2	266	Because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy.
15580403	3	363	In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy.
15580403	4	522	METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy.
15580403	5	735	After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day.
15580403	6	820	After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A).
15580403	7	938	However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group B).
15580403	8	1145	We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively.
15580403	9	1352	A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance.
15580403	10	1486	With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( P = 0.036).
15580403	11	1692	CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.
15638391	0	0	Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol.
15638391	1	126	The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia, induced by haloperidol (HAL) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe.
15638391	2	325	The study was performed on sexually mature male rats.
15638391	3	379	Serum concentrations of prolactin (PRL) and testosterone (T) were measured.
15638391	4	455	Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy.
15638391	5	522	Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti-Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) were performed.
15638391	6	619	In rats of the experimental group, the mean concentration of: PRL was more than twice higher, whereas T concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group.
15638391	7	792	Light microscopy visualized the following: hypertrophy and epithelium hyperplasia of the glandular ducts, associated with increased PCNA expression.
15638391	8	941	Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells, concerning organelles, engaged in protein synthesis and secretion.
1564236	0	0	Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography.
1564236	1	184	It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation.
1564236	2	440	The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis.
1564236	3	681	The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT).
1564236	4	894	During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced.
1564236	5	1061	The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002).
1564236	6	1169	During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography.
1564236	7	1325	The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia.
1564236	8	1462	The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02).
1564236	9	1589	Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03).
1564236	10	1896	Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis.
1564236	11	2072	The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 SPECT.
15673851	0	0	The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia.
15673851	1	196	We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats.
15673851	2	422	Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter.
15673851	3	510	In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation.
15673851	4	784	Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection).
15673851	5	921	Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis.
15673851	6	1072	After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05).
15673851	7	1220	This increase persisted for 8 hrs.
15673851	8	1255	IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group.
15673851	9	1407	These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation.
15673851	10	1565	We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation.
15686794	0	0	Acute low back pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone: a report of two cases.
15686794	1	92	Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of sinus rhythm.
15686794	2	239	We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent-onset atrial fibrillation, who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone loading.
15686794	3	438	Notably, this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature.
15686794	4	518	Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution.
15764424	0	0	Quantitative drug levels in stimulant psychosis: relationship to symptom severity, catecholamines and hyperkinesia.
15764424	1	116	To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, catecholamines, and psychotic symptoms, nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine- or cocaine-induced psychosis were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels.
15764424	2	476	Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating.
15764424	3	597	HVA levels were related to global hyperkinesia but not to psychopathology ratings.
15764424	4	680	Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role, intensity of stimulant-induced psychotic symptoms and stereotypies appears to be at least in part dose-related.
15811908	0	0	Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride.
15811908	1	55	OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride.
15811908	2	164	CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg.
15811908	3	338	Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment.
15811908	4	460	Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.
15811908	5	591	DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.
15811908	6	752	In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy.
15811908	7	906	CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma.
15811908	8	1066	Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and amisulpride.
15814210	0	0	Minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after dexamethasone treatment in very-low birth-weight infants.
15814210	1	170	The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants.
15814210	2	352	Thirty-three children after dexamethasone treatment were matched to 33 children without dexamethasone treatment.
15814210	3	465	Data were assessed at the age of 3-7 years.
15814210	4	509	Dexamethasone was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day.
15814210	5	625	Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, malformations, major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation.
15814210	6	845	Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor neurological dysfunctions and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw-a-Man Test.
15814210	7	1053	There were no differences in demographic data, growth, and socio-economic status between the two groups.
15814210	8	1158	Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group (p<0.01).
15814210	9	1258	In the Draw-a-Man Test, the control group showed better results (p<0.001).
15814210	10	1333	There were no differences in development of speech, social development, and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children.
15814210	11	1454	After dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions.
15814210	12	1551	Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis.
15814210	13	1626	Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of dexamethasone on neurological and cognitive development.
15858223	0	0	Valproic acid I: time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers, liver toxicity, and valproic acid metabolite levels in rats.
15858223	1	124	A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane (15-F(2t)-IsoP).
15858223	2	335	To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days.
15858223	3	583	Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs).
15858223	4	751	Plasma and liver 15-F(2t)-IsoP were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control.
15858223	5	868	Liver LPO levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment (1.8-fold versus control, p < 0.05).
15858223	6	965	Liver and plasma TBARs were not increased until 14 days (2-fold vs. control, p < 0.05).
15858223	7	1053	Liver toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology.
15858223	8	1169	Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to hepatotoxicity as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the study.
15858223	9	1388	The liver levels of beta-oxidation metabolites of VPA were decreased by day 14, while the levels of 4-ene-VPA and (E)-2,4-diene-VPA were not elevated throughout the study.
15858223	10	1560	Overall, these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of 15-F(2t)-IsoP, which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.
15867025	0	0	Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals.
15867025	1	96	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire.
15867025	2	227	METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals.
15867025	3	368	Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women.
15867025	4	750	RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high.
15867025	5	839	Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants.
15867025	6	912	All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin.
15867025	7	1029	Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination.
15867025	8	1176	The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest.
15867025	9	1400	Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%).
15867025	10	1494	In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women.
15867025	11	1593	CONCLUSION: This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire's birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement.
15893386	0	0	Succinylcholine-induced masseter muscle rigidity during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
15893386	1	106	Masseter muscle rigidity during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of malignant hyperthermia.
15893386	2	242	The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of masseter muscle rigidity.
15893386	3	384	Here, we describe a case of severe masseter muscle rigidity (jaw of steel) after succinylcholine (Sch) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
15893386	4	599	Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with propofol infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat malignant hyperthermia.
15897593	0	0	Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin.
15897593	1	132	PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use.
15897593	2	373	Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.
15897593	3	472	EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays.
15897593	4	852	Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.
15897593	5	1054	RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin.
15897593	6	1359	CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.
15897593	7	1679	Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane.
15897593	8	1791	Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity.
15897593	9	1979	If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.
15930398	0	0	Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with propofol.
15930398	1	93	OBJECTIVES: To assess patients' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with propofol, and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index (BIS) monitoring.
15930398	2	337	METHODS: This was a prospective, single-intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with propofol between December 28, 2002, and October 31, 2003.
15930398	3	519	BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status.
15930398	4	658	At 1-minute intervals during the procedural sedation, until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure, a word from a standardized list was read aloud, and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator.
15930398	5	917	The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient's ability to repeat the word were recorded.
15930398	6	1021	After the procedure, the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall, and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed.
15930398	7	1281	RESULTS: Seventy-five consenting patients were enrolled; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation.
15930398	8	1408	No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations.
15930398	9	1478	The mean (+/-standard deviation) time of data collection was 16.4 minutes (+/-7.1; range 5 to 34 minutes).
15930398	10	1585	The mean initial (preprocedure) BIS score was 97.1 (+/-2.3; range 92 to 99).
15930398	11	1662	The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66.9 (+/-14.4; range 33 to 91).
15930398	12	1768	The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77.1 (95% CI = 74.3 to 80.0).
15930398	13	1919	The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the inability to repeat words was 81.5 (95% CI = 78.1 to 84.8).
15930398	14	2027	The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96.7 (+/-2.4; range 84 to 98).
15930398	15	2166	The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91.2 (95% CI = 88.1 to 94.3).
15930398	16	2294	All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol.
15930398	17	2382	The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91.5 (+/-11.1; range 79 to 98), and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90.
15930398	18	2544	CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words.
15930398	19	2709	Furthermore, patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation, suggestive of retrograde amnesia.
1595783	0	0	Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.
1595783	1	31	Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis.
1595783	2	166	The pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
1595783	3	351	The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific.
1595783	4	467	The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities, such as heart failure, infection, and malignancy.
1595783	5	571	While withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases, this is not always possible or advisable.
1595783	6	696	Dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients.
15974569	0	0	Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR5 kainate receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of pain.
15974569	1	112	Amino acids 5 and 7, two potent and selective competitive GluR5 KA receptor antagonists, exhibited high GluR5 receptor affinity over other glutamate receptors.
15974569	2	272	Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of pain: reversal of formalin-induced paw licking, carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia, and capsaicin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia.
15985056	0	0	Possible azithromycin-associated hiccups.
15985056	1	42	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of persistent hiccups associated by azithromycin therapy.
15985056	2	128	CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis.
15985056	3	257	Hiccups were persistent and exhausting.
15985056	4	297	Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups.
15985056	5	381	No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation.
15985056	6	457	DISCUSSION: Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups.
15985056	7	542	Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups.
15985056	8	777	Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials.
15985056	9	867	Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups.
15985056	10	1151	Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient.
15985056	11	1270	CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of drug-induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination.
15985056	12	1383	However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.
16006300	0	0	Calcium carbonate toxicity: the updated milk-alkali syndrome; report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
16006300	1	110	OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate-induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk-alkali syndrome.
16006300	2	266	METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali syndrome.
16006300	3	475	RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations.
16006300	4	660	No malignant lesion was found.
16006300	5	691	Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide.
16006300	6	765	The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia.
16006300	7	924	Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of calcium carbonate.
16006300	8	1066	In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk-alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003.
16006300	9	1275	CONCLUSION: Milk-alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons.
16006300	10	1461	Treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate.
16006300	11	1568	Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia.
16047871	0	0	Warfarin-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
16047871	1	46	Skin reactions associated with oral coumarin-derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence.
16047871	2	142	Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LV) is primarily a cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, though systemic involvement may be encountered.
16047871	3	273	We report 4 patients with late-onset LV probably due to warfarin.
16047871	4	339	All 4 patients presented with skin eruptions that developed after receiving warfarin for several years.
16047871	5	443	The results of skin lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients, confirming LV Cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinued.
16047871	6	599	In 2 of the 4 patients, rechallenge with warfarin led to recurrence of the lesions.
16047871	7	683	LV may be a late-onset adverse reaction associated with warfarin therapy.
1610717	0	0	Cocaine-induced brainstem seizures and behavior.
1610717	1	49	A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine.
1610717	2	328	The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations.
1610717	3	481	Cocaine (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study.
1610717	4	625	Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects.
1610717	5	754	The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, "beating drum" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching.
1610717	6	949	Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states.
1610717	7	1068	Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation.
1610717	8	1256	These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation.
1610717	9	1414	Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates.
1610717	10	1597	Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.
16116131	0	0	rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease.
16116131	1	93	The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa-induced dyskinesia are unclear.
16116131	2	182	Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson disease, the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a dyskinetic state induced by continuous apomorphine infusion.
16116131	3	495	rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce drug-induced dyskinesias, whereas 5-Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase.
16132524	0	0	Intracavitary chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases) for recurrent glioblastoma -- clinical observations.
16132524	1	137	Human malignant brain tumors have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy.
16132524	2	231	Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers, separating two congruent networks of water channels.
16132524	3	345	Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs, the gel-like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity.
16132524	4	468	For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study.
16132524	5	701	A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages.
16132524	6	901	Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain edema, while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel.
16132524	7	1079	In the latter group, brain edema was markedly reduced and dealt medically.
16132524	8	1154	Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma using cubic phases is feasible and safe, yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study.
16157917	0	0	Lamotrigine associated with exacerbation or de novo myoclonus in idiopathic generalized epilepsies.
16157917	1	100	Five patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) treated with lamotrigine (LTG) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic jerks (MJ).
16157917	2	262	In three patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration.
16157917	3	368	MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50%.
16157917	4	425	In two patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a delayed but more severe manner, with myoclonic status that only ceased after LTG withdrawal.
16174948	0	0	Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage.
16174948	1	93	INTRODUCTION: Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications, including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis.
16174948	2	225	However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries.
16174948	3	319	Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use.
16174948	4	501	METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites.
16174948	5	640	Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter.
16174948	6	846	Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made.
16174948	7	910	RESULTS: Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls.
16174948	8	1000	There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests).
16174948	9	1286	There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests).
16174948	10	1642	Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group.
16174948	11	1742	CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal SAH associated with cocaine use.
16192988	0	0	Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness.
16192988	1	131	Aggressive behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric disorders, and are common in methamphetamine (METH) abusers.
16192988	2	277	Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD-1 mice.
16192988	3	403	This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH-induced hyperactivity.
16192988	4	484	Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single METH injections.
16192988	5	667	There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of METH.
16192988	6	826	MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of METH, but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of METH.
16192988	7	966	In the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of METH.
16192988	8	1101	These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of aggressive behaviors in mice.
16225977	0	0	Amisulpride related tic-like symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic.
16225977	1	70	Tic disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone.
16225977	2	187	However, there are two case reports that show tic-like symptoms, including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine.
16225977	3	346	We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary eye-blinking movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day).
16225977	4	507	The tic-like symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day.
16225977	5	614	However, her psychosis recurred after the dose reduction.
16225977	6	672	We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of quetiapine.
16225977	7	738	She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function.
16225977	8	863	No more tic-like symptoms or other side effects have been reported.
16225977	9	931	Together with previously reported cases, our patient suggests that tic-like symptoms might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, clozapine, or amisulpride.
1628552	0	0	Chloroquine related complete heart block with blindness: case report.
1628552	1	70	A 27-year old African woman with history of regular chloroquine ingestion presented with progressive deterioration of vision, easy fatiguability, dyspnoea, dizziness progressing to syncopal attacks.
1628552	2	269	Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of chloroquine retinopathy, cardiac assessment revealed features of heart failure and a complete heart block with right bundle branch block pattern.
1628552	3	464	The heart block was treated by pacemaker insertion and the heart failure resolved spontaneously following chloroquine discontinuation.
1628552	4	599	She however remains blind.
1636026	0	0	Effects of suprofen on the isolated perfused rat kidney.
1636026	1	57	Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear.
1636026	2	210	The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell-free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg/dL of uric acid.
1636026	3	419	There were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion, oxygen consumption, or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with suprofen compared with the drug-free control groups.
1636026	4	604	In contrast, a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of suprofen to the kidney perfused with uric acid; no changes were found with suprofen in the absence of uric acid.
1636026	5	818	A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given suprofen, compared with drug-free controls.
1636026	6	953	However, the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period.
1636026	7	1063	In summary, suprofen causes acute declines in renal function, most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid.
16364460	0	0	Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia in adult male rats.
16364460	1	121	The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated.
16364460	2	277	Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus.
16364460	3	376	One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day.
16364460	4	741	Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged.
16364460	5	868	In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems.
16364460	6	1024	The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group.
16364460	7	1184	Ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO-treated group.
16364460	8	1328	However, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats.
16364460	9	1505	Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia.
16418614	0	0	PTU-associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner Syndrome and Graves' disease.
16418614	1	78	Palpable purpura is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes, including infectious and autoimmune processes.
16418614	2	223	A rare cause, drug-induced vasculitis, may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in response to a medication.
16418614	3	371	We report a girl with Turner syndrome and Graves' disease who presented with palpable purpuric lesions.
16418614	4	475	The diagnosis of propylthiouracil (PTU)-associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU.
16418614	5	725	Subsequent treatment of persistent hyperthyroidism with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the vasculitis, a complication described in prior case reports.
16428827	0	0	Daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from MC-IXC cells and improves drug-induced amnesia.
16428827	1	98	The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh), is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
16428827	2	327	Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro.
16428827	3	429	Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone).
16428827	4	572	In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests.
16428827	5	746	Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test.
16428827	6	912	Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior).
16428827	7	1040	By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior).
16428827	8	1243	These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia.
16471092	0	0	Urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with overactive bladder after tolterodine treatment.
16471092	1	112	OBJECTIVES: To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with overactive bladder (OAB) after tolterodine treatment.
16471092	2	255	MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty women (aged 30-77 years) diagnosed as having OAB at the Gynecology Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study.
16471092	3	458	Tolterodine 2 mg, twice daily was given.
16471092	4	499	After 8 weeks treatment, changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined.
16471092	5	597	Short form 36 (SF36) questionaires (Thai version) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment.
16471092	6	697	RESULTS: At 8 weeks, all micturition per day decreased from 16. 7 +/- 5. 3 to 6. 7 +/- 2.4 times per day.
16471092	7	803	The number of nocturia episodes decreased from 5.4 +/- 4.2 to 1.1 +/- 1.0 times per night.
16471092	8	894	The most common side effect was dry month in 5 cases (16.7%) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree.
16471092	9	1027	Only one case (3.3%) withdrew from the present study due to a severe dry mouth.
16471092	10	1107	The SF-36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning, role function emotional, social function and mental heath.
16471092	11	1245	CONCLUSION: Tolterodine was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with OAB.
16563323	0	0	Remifentanil pretreatment reduces myoclonus after etomidate.
16563323	1	61	STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of myoclonus after anesthesia induction with etomidate.
16563323	2	269	DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind study.
16563323	3	320	SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital.
16563323	4	379	PATIENTS: Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double-blinded fashion with remifentanil 1 microg/kg or placebo.
16563323	5	501	Two minutes after remifentanil or placebo injection, etomidate 0.3 mg/kg was given.
16563323	6	585	MEASUREMENTS: Myoclonus was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3.
16563323	7	646	The grade of sedation (none, mild, moderate, severe), nausea, pruritus, and apnea were recorded after injection of both drugs.
16563323	8	773	MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group (6.7%) than in the placebo group (70%) (P < 0.001).
16563323	9	916	None of the patients experienced sedation, apnea, nausea, or pruritus after injection of both drugs.
16563323	10	1017	In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration.
16563323	11	1153	CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg reduced myoclonus after etomidate induction without side effects such as sedation, apnea, nausea, or pruritus.
16563323	12	1319	Men experience increased incidence of myoclonus than women after etomidate administration.
16574713	0	0	Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy (MDMA) users.
16574713	1	94	Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function.
16574713	2	400	Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning.
16574713	3	702	The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR.
16574713	4	902	A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males.
16574713	5	997	Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests.
16574713	6	1211	DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59).
16574713	7	1492	Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls.
16574713	8	1579	In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users.
16574713	9	1662	No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed.
16574713	10	1720	While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments.
16574713	11	1909	No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed.
16584858	0	0	Role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats.
16584858	1	125	The current study dealt with the protective role of mangiferin, a polyphenol from Mangifera indica Linn. (Anacardiaceae), on isoproterenol (ISPH)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism.
16584858	2	351	Subcutaneous injection of ISPH (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased uric acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity.
16584858	3	690	The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic myocardium.
16584858	4	852	The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats.
16584858	5	1133	Upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels.
16584858	6	1352	Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH-induced MI rats.
16584858	7	1529	From the present study it is concluded that mangiferin exerts a beneficial effect against ISPH-induced MI due to its antioxidant potential, which regulated the tissues defense system against cardiac damage.
16586083	0	0	Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors: general problem with substance specific differences?
16586083	1	105	Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.
16586083	2	301	Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors.
16586083	3	413	Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention.
16586083	4	572	The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time.
16586083	5	682	A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects.
16586083	6	947	Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.
16596970	0	0	Pilocarpine seizures cause age-dependent impairment in auditory location discrimination.
16596970	1	89	Children who have status epilepticus have continuous or rapidly repeating seizures that may be life-threatening and may cause life-long changes in brain and behavior.
16596970	2	256	The extent to which status epilepticus causes deficits in auditory discrimination is unknown.
16596970	3	350	A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of status epilepticus.
16596970	4	485	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day (P) 20, or a convulsant dose of pilocarpine on P20 or P45.
16596970	5	612	Pilocarpine on either day induced status epilepticus; status epilepticus at P45 resulted in CA3 cell loss and spontaneous seizures, whereas P20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous seizures.
16596970	6	803	Mature rats were trained with sound-source location and sound-silence discriminations.
16596970	7	890	Control (saline P20) rats acquired both discriminations immediately.
16596970	8	959	In status epilepticus (P20) rats, acquisition of the sound-source location discrimination was moderately impaired.
16596970	9	1074	Status epilepticus (P45) rats failed to acquire either sound-source location or sound-silence discriminations.
16596970	10	1185	Status epilepticus in rat causes an age-dependent, long-term impairment in auditory discrimination.
16596970	11	1285	This impairment may explain one cause of impaired auditory location discrimination in humans.
16600756	0	0	Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder.
16600756	1	96	PURPOSE: NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine.
16600756	2	231	We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB.
16600756	3	297	MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls.
16600756	4	420	Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies.
16600756	5	509	Urine samples were collected.
16600756	6	539	NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups.
16600756	7	656	In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined.
16600756	8	772	RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05).
16600756	9	897	However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB.
16600756	10	977	In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05).
16600756	11	1113	Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB.
16600756	12	1212	CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients.
16600756	13	1313	Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate OAB symptoms.
16629641	0	0	Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus.
16629641	1	81	Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease.
16629641	2	210	The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.
16629641	3	319	Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia.
16629641	4	493	Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders.
16629641	5	716	In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life.
16629641	6	857	Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates.
16629641	7	1022	Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.
16629641	8	1146	Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
16634859	0	0	Impact of alcohol exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures.
16634859	1	98	BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged.
16634859	2	310	Early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes.
16634859	3	412	This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting alcohol-related fetal growth impairment.
16634859	4	511	METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention study.
16634859	5	688	The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies.
16634859	6	872	Because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) alcohol consumers.
16634859	7	1064	Fetal measures from the heavy-exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal, uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics.
16634859	8	1247	Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug abuse.
16634859	9	1407	RESULTS: Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies.
16634859	10	1500	When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-alcohol-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns.
16634859	11	1692	Any alcohol consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers.
16634859	12	1924	Amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios.
16634859	13	1998	CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies.
16634859	14	2171	Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects.
16710500	0	0	Ethambutol-associated optic neuropathy.
16710500	1	40	INTRODUCTION: Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss.
16710500	2	201	We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia.
16710500	3	263	CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described.
16710500	4	361	All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (Ishihara) and visual field.
16710500	5	454	The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm.
16710500	6	546	TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months.
16710500	7	658	Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases.
16710500	8	702	In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale.
16710500	9	795	OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function.
16710500	10	863	CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up.
16710500	11	1028	The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.
16720068	0	0	Possible neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to concomitant treatment with paroxetine and alprazolam.
16720068	1	105	A 74-year-old man with depressive symptoms was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to insomnia, loss of appetite, exhaustion, and agitation.
16720068	2	249	Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg paroxetine and 1.2 mg alprazolam.
16720068	3	340	On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors.
16720068	4	507	The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms.
16720068	5	650	Laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase (2218 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase (134 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (78 IU/L), and BUN (27.9 mg/ml) levels.
16720068	6	830	The patient received bromocriptine and diazepam to treat his symptoms. 7 days later, the fever disappeared and the patient's serum CPK levels were normalized (175 IU/L).
16720068	7	1000	This patient presented with symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), thus demonstrating that NMS-like symptoms can occur after combined paroxetine and alprazolam treatment.
16720068	8	1182	The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case, indicating a probable relationship between the patient's NMS-like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case.
16720068	9	1396	The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected.
16720068	10	1493	Several risk factors for NMS should be noted in elderly depressive patients whose symptoms often include dehydration, agitation, malnutrition, and exhaustion.
16720068	11	1652	Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from depression.
16725121	0	0	Down-regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics-induced convulsions and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics.
16725121	1	253	Alterations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice.
16725121	2	442	Daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae.
16725121	3	627	Co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect.
16725121	4	722	Daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus.
16725121	5	809	Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions.
16725121	6	967	Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine.
16725121	7	1135	These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions.
16725121	8	1325	Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function.
16725121	9	1441	Repeated administration of cocaine induces up-regulation of hippocampal NET function.
16725121	10	1527	Desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine.
16820346	0	0	Atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.
16820346	1	83	To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days.
16820346	2	279	Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001).
16820346	3	443	In this prevention study, SBP in the atorva + dex group was increased from 115 +/- 0.4 to 124 +/- 1.5 mmHg, but this was significantly lower than in the dex-only group (P' < 0.05).
16820346	4	624	Atorva reversed dex-induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex, 1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex, P < 0.0001).
16820346	5	811	Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in dex-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats (11.2 +/- 1.08 microm, 15.3 +/- 1.17 microm, respectively, P < 0.05).
16820346	6	976	Atorva affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight.
16820346	7	1030	Thus, atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat.
16826348	0	0	Peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia.
16826348	1	115	The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported.
16826348	2	311	A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.
16826348	3	381	After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy.
16826348	4	546	The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot.
16826348	5	733	Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves.
16826348	6	831	This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone.
16826348	7	1085	Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.
16844102	0	0	Effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
16844102	1	86	Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals.
16844102	2	218	This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity.
16844102	3	396	Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections).
16844102	4	470	The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration.
16844102	5	647	The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity.
16844102	6	933	The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats.
16844102	7	1052	These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO.
16844102	8	1117	This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.
1687392	0	0	Blockade of both D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors may induce catalepsy in mice. 1.
1687392	1	81	The catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists has been tested and the possible dopamine subtypes involved in catalepsy was determined. 2.
1687392	2	219	Dopamine antagonist fluphenazine, D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 or D-2 antagonist sulpiride induced catalepsy.
1687392	3	325	The effect of fluphenazine and sulpiride was dose-dependent.
1687392	4	386	Combination of SCH 23390 with sulpiride did not induce catalepsy potentiation. 3.
1687392	5	468	D-1 agonist SKF 38393 or D-2 agonist quinpirole decreased the catalepsy induced by fluphenazine, SCH 23390 or sulpiride. 4.
1687392	6	592	Combination of SKF 38393 with quinpirole did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists. 5.
1687392	7	726	The data may indicate that although D-2 receptor blockade is involved in catalepsy, the D-1 receptor may plan a role.
16960342	0	0	Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy.
16960342	1	144	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a major health problem in Asian countries.
16960342	2	289	Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now.
16960342	3	495	In this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy.
16960342	4	642	The patient was a 50-year-old woman.
16960342	5	679	Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital.
16960342	6	810	However, the administration of lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity.
16960342	7	944	During this period, no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged, and the serum HBV-DNA level was continuously suppressed.
16960342	8	1059	These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued.
16960342	9	1159	Moreover, both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient.
16960342	10	1267	The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.
1700207	0	0	Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias.
1700207	1	92	Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models.
1700207	2	216	Digitalis arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs.
1700207	3	386	Adrenaline arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane-anesthetized dogs.
1700207	4	520	Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias, respectively.
1700207	5	629	The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6).
1700207	6	825	A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis-induced arrhythmia, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline-induced arrhythmias.
1700207	7	994	The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6).
1700207	8	1191	The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-cibenzoline indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing Na channels, but effects of both drugs on Ca channels may be almost equipotent.
17019386	0	0	Passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon.
17019386	1	92	A study on 21 patients.
17019386	2	116	AIM: Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon.
17019386	3	280	Leakage of mannitol into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound .
17019386	4	435	This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals.
17019386	5	494	As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients.
17019386	6	646	METHODS: Mannitol (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy.
17019386	7	834	During resection, a sample of the surrounding edematous white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample.
17019386	8	962	Mannitol concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al.
17019386	9	1089	RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times).
17019386	10	1221	In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells.
17019386	11	1399	CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that even after a single bolus, mannitol may leak through the altered BBB near gliomas, reversing the initial plasma-to-blood osmotic gradient, aggravating peritumoral edema and promoting rebound of ICP.
17042884	0	0	Placebo-level incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with quetiapine in controlled studies of patients with bipolar mania.
17042884	1	127	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including akathisia, with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania.
17042884	2	251	METHODS: Data were analyzed from four similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, 3- to 12-week studies.
17042884	3	358	Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or haloperidol monotherapy as respective active controls.
17042884	4	529	Two studies evaluated quetiapine (up to 800 mg/day) in combination with a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex, QTP + Li/DVP) (n = 196) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer (PBO + Li/DVP) (n = 203).
17042884	5	733	Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage.
17042884	6	905	RESULTS: The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including akathisia, was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%).
17042884	7	1060	Similarly, EPS-related adverse events with QTP + Li/DVP (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + Li/DVP (19.2%).
17042884	8	1174	Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS.
17042884	9	1392	The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li/DVP (4.9%).
17042884	10	1548	Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of tremor (18.4%) than quetiapine (5.6%); cerebellar tremor, which is a known adverse effect of lithium, may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy.
17042884	11	1816	Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of akathisia (33.3% versus 5.9%), tremor (30.3% versus 7.8%), and extrapyramidal syndrome (35.4% versus 5.9%) than quetiapine.
17042884	12	2008	No significant differences were observed between quetiapine and placebo on SAS and BARS scores.
17042884	13	2104	Anticholinergic use was low and similar with quetiapine or placebo.
17042884	14	2172	CONCLUSIONS: In bipolar mania, the incidence of EPS, including akathisia, with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo.
17049862	0	0	Is phenytoin administration safe in a hypothermic child?
17049862	1	57	A male neonate with a Chiari malformation and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele.
17049862	2	219	During anaesthesia and surgery, he inadvertently became moderately hypothermic.
17049862	3	299	Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis.
17049862	4	400	Following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia, refractory to atropine and adrenaline.
17049862	5	523	The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive.
17049862	6	600	Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children.
17049862	7	709	As phenytoin is a commonly used drug, clinicians need to be aware of this interaction.
17074608	0	0	Valproate-induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia.
17074608	1	84	Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments.
17074608	2	277	In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation.
17074608	3	416	An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner.
17074608	4	541	This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation, who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.
1711760	0	0	Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia: effect on brain edema.
1711760	1	91	The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied.
1711760	2	268	Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded.
1711760	3	357	In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated.
1711760	4	441	In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO.
1711760	5	538	Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested.
1711760	6	608	The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO.
1711760	7	711	Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory).
1711760	8	844	The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining.
1711760	9	929	In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.
1711760	10	1028	In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05).
1711760	11	1209	The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05).
1711760	12	1382	The data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.
17194457	0	0	Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic steroid exposure in male rats with low serotonin.
17194457	1	101	The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure and brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats.
17194457	2	309	Serotonin was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA 100 mg/kg, every other day); controls received saline.
17194457	3	452	At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with testosterone (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week).
17194457	4	591	Behavioral measures included locomotion, irritability, copulation, partner preference, and aggression.
17194457	5	694	Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch).
17194457	6	811	Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC.
17194457	7	917	PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined.
17194457	8	1010	Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA.
17194457	9	1133	Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression.
17194457	10	1307	T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression.
17194457	11	1426	The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation.
17194457	12	1623	Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit aggressive behavior.
17241657	0	0	Effects of UMB24 and (+/-)-SM 21, putative sigma2-preferring antagonists, on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of cocaine in mice.
17241657	1	136	Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive, lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice.
17241657	2	305	In contrast, the contribution of sigma2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable.
17241657	3	445	To begin addressing this need, we characterized UMB24 (1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies.
17241657	4	647	Receptor binding studies confirmed that UMB24 and (+/-)-SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors.
17241657	5	773	In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or (+/-)-SM 21 significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions and locomotor activity, but not lethality.
17241657	6	953	When administered alone, (+/-)-SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but UMB24 had locomotor depressant actions.
17241657	7	1108	Together, the data suggest that sigma2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine, and further development of more selective, high affinity ligands are warranted.
17263743	0	0	Cardiac arrest in a child with cerebral palsy undergoing sevoflurane induction of anesthesia after preoperative clonidine.
17263743	1	123	Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure.
17263743	2	238	We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump.
17263743	3	406	Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety.
17263743	4	581	During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation.
17263743	5	696	There are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.
17285209	0	0	Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema of the stomach and small intestine: a case report.
17285209	1	119	This is a case report on a 45-year old African-American female with newly diagnosed hypertension, who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine/benazapril 10/5 mg.
17285209	2	289	The very next day, she presented at the emergency room (ER) with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
17285209	3	391	Physical exam, complete metabolic panel, and hemogram were in the normal range.
17285209	4	471	She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics.
17285209	5	560	However, she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints.
17285209	6	631	This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion.
17285209	7	728	CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach, duodenum and jejunum, along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity.
17285209	8	877	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced angioedema was suspected, and anti-hypertensive medications were discontinued.
17285209	9	1011	Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours, and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of ascites.
17285209	10	1181	The recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) intestinal angioedema constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians, internists, emergency room personal and surgeons.
1728915	0	0	Carbamazepine-induced cardiac dysfunction.
1728915	1	43	Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes.
1728915	2	96	A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, induced by carbamazepine, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases.
1728915	3	257	From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine-associated cardiac dysfunction emerged.
1728915	4	367	One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose.
1728915	5	466	The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels.
1728915	6	711	Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.
1732442	0	0	Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy with iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine.
1732442	1	135	Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analog of norepinephrine (NE), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function.
1732442	2	278	Using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy.
1732442	3	485	The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week).
1732442	4	630	There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group.
1732442	5	934	Myocardial accumulation of [125I]MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less.
1732442	6	1078	However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05).
1732442	7	1299	In the 5-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001).
1732442	8	1446	In the 8-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001).
1732442	9	1593	Thus, MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner.
1732442	10	1685	The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.
17344330	0	0	Syncope and QT prolongation among patients treated with methadone for heroin dependence in the city of Copenhagen.
17344330	1	115	BACKGROUND: Methadone is prescribed to heroin addicts to decrease illicit opioid use.
17344330	2	201	Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade de pointes (TdP) has been reported in methadone users.
17344330	3	324	As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone.
17344330	4	641	METHODS: In this cross-sectional study interview, ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult heroin addicts treated with methadone or buprenorphine on a daily basis.
17344330	5	827	Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen, 450 (approximately 52%) were included.
17344330	6	944	The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs.
17344330	7	993	All participants were interviewed about any experience of syncope.
17344330	8	1060	The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.
17344330	9	1237	RESULTS: Methadone dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0.140 ms/mg (p = 0.002).
17344330	10	1328	No association between buprenorphine and QTc was found.
17344330	11	1384	Among the subjects treated with methadone, 28% men and 32% women had prolonged QTc interval.
17344330	12	1477	None of the subjects treated with buprenorphine had QTc interval >0.440 s((1/2)).
17344330	13	1559	A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope.
17344330	14	1666	CONCLUSIONS: Methadone is associated with QT prolongation and higher reporting of syncope in a population of heroin addicts.
17366349	0	0	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by ziprasidone on the second day of treatment.
17366349	1	86	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic-induced movement disorders.
17366349	2	201	We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of ziprasidone.
17366349	3	300	Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause.
17366349	4	443	The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone.
17366349	5	635	This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to ziprasidone reported in the literature.
17490790	0	0	Peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nigra.
17490790	1	94	Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
17490790	2	185	To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' iron staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron dextran overloaded animals.
17490790	3	625	The findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the SN.
17490790	4	789	As a result, dopamine release and content, as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen.
17490790	5	903	Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group.
17490790	6	968	These results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the SN, where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.
17490790	7	1128	The chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload.
17490864	0	0	Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats.
17490864	1	149	The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease.
17490864	2	342	We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats.
17490864	3	540	Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress.
17490864	4	811	Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups.
17490864	5	941	The serotonin-1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups.
17490864	6	1042	Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups.
17490864	7	1113	These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI.
17490864	8	1316	The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.
17511042	0	0	An extremely rare case of delusional parasitosis in a chronic hepatitis C patient during pegylated interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin treatment.
17511042	1	144	During treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with interferon and ribavirin, a lot of side effects are described.
17511042	2	261	Twenty-three percent to 44% of patients develop depression.
17511042	3	321	A minority of patients evolve to psychosis.
17511042	4	365	To the best of our knowledge, no cases of psychogenic parasitosis occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature.
17511042	5	506	We present a 49-year-old woman who developed a delusional parasitosis during treatment with pegylated interferon alpha-2b weekly and ribavirin.
17511042	6	650	She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools.
17511042	7	724	This could not be confirmed by any technical examination.
17511042	8	782	All the complaints disappeared after stopping pegylated interferon alpha-2b and reappeared after restarting it.
17511042	9	894	She had a complete sustained viral response.
17574447	0	0	Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long-term phenobarbital therapy: an autopsy report of two patients.
17574447	1	110	Phenobarbital (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease.
17574447	2	326	Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia.
17574447	3	505	At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of necrosis surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue.
17574447	4	753	Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen.
17574447	5	839	Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences.
17574447	6	977	For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of PB-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.
17682013	0	0	Delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke-like presentation in chemotherapy recipients.
17682013	1	86	BACKGROUND: A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia.
17682013	2	300	Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration.
17682013	3	448	METHODS: We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke-like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy.
17682013	4	630	We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data.
17682013	5	693	Patients with cerebrovascular accidents were excluded.
17682013	6	748	RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur, and capecitabine.
17682013	7	936	Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum, corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (available in 21/27 patients).
17682013	8	1249	Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories.
17682013	9	1313	Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities.
17682013	10	1416	However, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormalities.
17682013	11	1538	CONCLUSIONS: Several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed.
17682013	12	1691	DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome.
17702969	0	0	Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces fetal pulmonary hypertension in the rat.
17702969	1	81	RATIONALE: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women.
17702969	2	193	Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary hypertension syndrome of the newborn.
17702969	3	345	The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a pulmonary hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents.
17702969	4	523	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the fluoxetine effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate.
17702969	5	666	METHODS: Pregnant rats were treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation.
17702969	6	770	MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section.
17702969	7	845	As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01).
17702969	8	1119	Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals, and arterial oxygen saturation was 96 +/- 1% in 1-day-old control animals and significantly lower (P < 0.01) in fluoxetine-exposed pups (79 +/- 2%).
17702969	9	1330	In vitro, fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal, but not adult, animals (P < 0.01) and reduced serotonin-induced contraction at both ages (P < 0.01).
17702969	10	1508	After in utero exposure to a low fluoxetine concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal, but not adult, cells (P < 0.01).
17702969	11	1698	CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, fluoxetine exposure in utero induces pulmonary hypertension in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.
17786501	0	0	Disulfiram-induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy: a case report.
17786501	1	77	AIM: To report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of disulfiram for alcohol dependence management.
17786501	2	201	MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case report.
17786501	3	239	RESULTS: A 57-year-old male presented with gradual loss of vision in both eyes with intermittent headaches for 2 months.
17786501	4	360	He also complained of paraesthesia with numbness in both feet.
17786501	5	423	His vision was 6/15 and 2/60 in the right and left eyes, respectively.
17786501	6	494	Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads.
17786501	7	553	Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central-caecal scotomata.
17786501	8	620	He had been taking disulfiram for alcohol dependence for the preceding 3 years.
17786501	9	700	Disulfiram discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement.
17786501	10	773	CONCLUSION: Physicians initiating long-term disulfiram therapy should be aware of these adverse effects.
17786501	11	878	They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing.
17786501	12	953	Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects.
17923537	0	0	Intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis treated with fluocinolone acetonide implants.
17923537	1	92	OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone acetonide (FA) intravitreal implant.
17923537	2	273	DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0.59-mg or 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed.
17923537	3	498	RESULTS: During the 3-year follow-up, 71.0% of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55.1%, 24.7%, and 6.2% of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more, 40 mm Hg or more, and 50 mm Hg or more, respectively.
17923537	4	739	Topical IOP-lowering medication was administered in 74.8% of implanted eyes, and IOP-lowering surgeries, most of which were trabeculectomies (76.2%), were performed on 36.6% of implanted eyes.
17923537	5	932	Intraocular pressure-lowering surgeries were considered a success (postoperative IOP of 6-21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP-lowering medication) in 85.1% of eyes at 1 year.
17923537	6	1111	The rate of hypotony (IOP </= 5 mm Hg) following IOP-lowering surgery (42.5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery (35.4%) (P = .09).
17923537	7	1279	CONCLUSION: Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery.
17943461	0	0	Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT-induced cardiomyopathy.
17943461	1	89	BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients.
17943461	2	250	Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies.
17943461	3	459	METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml).
17943461	4	889	After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods.
17943461	5	1034	NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function.
17943461	6	1126	In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles.
17943461	7	1313	These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis.
17943461	8	1560	These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity.
17943461	9	1688	CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.
17965424	0	0	Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).
17965424	1	190	OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
17965424	2	378	PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054).
17965424	3	570	Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed.
17965424	4	635	The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs).
17965424	5	792	General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data.
17965424	6	886	Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale).
17965424	7	989	RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively.
17965424	8	1145	The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)).
17965424	9	1360	The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema).
17965424	10	1616	Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively).
17965424	11	1746	CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg.
17965424	12	1891	Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.
17975693	0	0	Anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rats.
17975693	1	63	INTRODUCTION: The possible anxiogenic effects of fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex, weighing 150-200 g. METHODS: The drugs were given orally, in doses of 50 mg/kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day.
17975693	2	395	The tests included open-field exploratory behaviour, elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency behaviour.
17975693	3	560	RESULTS: The results indicate that ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied.
17975693	4	725	However, ciprofloxacin- and norfloxacin-treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters.
17975693	5	858	CONCLUSION: The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.
18006530	0	0	Reduction of pain during induction with target-controlled propofol and remifentanil.
18006530	1	85	BACKGROUND: Pain on injection of propofol is unpleasant.
18006530	2	142	We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used.
18006530	3	355	A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent the pain without producing complications.
18006530	4	552	METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or remifentanil to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI.
18006530	5	783	After the target Ce was achieved, the infusion of propofol was started.
18006530	6	855	Remifentanil-related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion, and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four-point scale during the propofol infusion.
18006530	7	1035	RESULTS: The incidence of pain was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12/32 and 6/31 vs 26/31 and 25/32, respectively, P<0.001).
18006530	8	1204	Pain was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001).
18006530	9	1290	However, both incidence and severity of pain were not different between Groups R4 and R6.
18006530	10	1380	No significant complications were observed during the study.
18006530	11	1441	CONCLUSIONS: During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of propofol and remifentanil, a significant reduction in propofol infusion pain was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of remifentanil at a target Ce of 4 ng ml(-1).
18086064	0	0	Dexmedetomidine and cardiac protection for non-cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
18086064	1	113	We conducted a systematic review of the effects of dexmedetomidine on cardiac outcomes following non-cardiac surgery.
18086064	2	231	We included prospective, randomised peri-operative studies of dexmedetomidine that reported mortality, cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events.
18086064	3	376	A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007.
18086064	4	442	The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials.
18086064	5	517	Of 425 studies identified, 20 were included in the meta-analysis (840 patients).
18086064	6	598	Dexmedetomidine was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes; all-cause mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01-7.13, p = 0.44), non-fatal myocardial infarction (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04-1.60, p = 0.14), and myocardial ischaemia (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26-1.63, p = 0.36).
18086064	7	871	Peri-operative hypotension (26%, OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.91-7.54, p = 0.0001) and bradycardia (17%, OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.98-9.95, p < 0.00001) were significantly increased.
18086064	8	1035	An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of bradycardia (p = 0.43).
18086064	9	1110	A randomised placebo-controlled trial of dexmedetomidine is warranted.
18161408	0	0	Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a case report.
18161408	1	110	BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction.
18161408	2	194	It is considered safe, with minimal side effects.
18161408	3	244	Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC.
18161408	4	362	Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (MI) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram.
18161408	5	587	CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain.
18161408	6	717	An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction.
18161408	7	796	Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL.
18161408	8	860	An initial exercise stress test was normal.
18161408	9	904	At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester.
18161408	10	1059	It showed normal coronary vessels.
18161408	11	1094	CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction.
18161408	12	1222	Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC.
18161408	13	1283	Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.
18177388	0	0	Reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome (reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use.
18177388	1	151	Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome was first described in Japan as "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."
18177388	2	265	This syndrome has been identified in many other countries.
18177388	3	324	Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature.
18177388	4	405	One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome, with hyperdynamic apex and complete akinesia of the base (as opposed to the classic apical ballooning).
18177388	5	565	In this article, we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballooning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use.
18177388	6	734	This report is followed by review of the literature.
18201582	0	0	Results of a comparative, phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of telmisartan and amlodipine versus amlodipine monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II hypertension.
18201582	1	274	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg (T+A) compared with amlodipine 5-mg monotherapy (A) in adult Indian patients with stage II hypertension.
18201582	2	535	METHODS: This comparative, Phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II hypertension.
18201582	3	732	Patients were treated with oral FDC of T+A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks; blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position.
18201582	4	888	Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP (SBP)/ diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to study end and number of responders (ie, patients who achieved target SBP/ DBP <130/<80 mm Hg) at end of study.
18201582	5	1109	Tolerability was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events, identified using physical examination, laboratory analysis, and electrocardiography.
18201582	6	1258	RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study; 203 patients (143 men, 60 women) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow-up (4 patients in the T+A group and 3 in the A group) and considered with-drawn.
18201582	7	1481	At study end, statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP (T+A [-27.4%]; A [-16.6%]) and DBP (T+A [-20.1%]; A [-13.3%]) (all, P < 0.05).
18201582	8	1690	Response rates were 87.3% (89/102) in the T+A group and 69.3% (70/101) in the A group (P < 0.05).
18201582	9	1788	The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups (T+A, 16.0% [17/106]; A, 15.4% [16/104]).
18201582	10	1928	Peripheral edema was reported in 8.5% patients (9/106) in the T+A group compared with 13.5% (14/104) in the A group, and cough was reported in 3.8% patients (4/106) in the T+A group and 1.0% (1/104) patients in the A group; these differences did not reach statistical significance.
18201582	11	2210	The incidences of headache, dizziness, and diarrhea were similar between the 2 groups.
18201582	12	2297	CONCLUSIONS: Among these Indian patients with stage II hypertension, the FDC of T+A was found to be significantly more effective, with regard to BP reductions, than A, and both treatments were well tolerated.
18239197	0	0	Increased mental slowing associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after trihexyphenidyl oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly.
18239197	1	139	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl-induced subjective effects and objective memory performance.
18239197	2	444	METHODS: This study comprised 24 cognitively intact, health elderly adults (12 APOE epsilon4 carriers) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic.
18239197	3	602	This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, three-way, crossover experimental design.
18239197	4	701	All participants received 1.0 mg or 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks.
18239197	5	855	Bond and Lader's visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline, 1, 2.5, and 5 hours postdrug administration.
18239197	6	1062	RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only.
18239197	7	1215	Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only.
18239197	8	1477	However, no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear-headedness.
18239197	9	1605	CONCLUSION: The epsilon4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective mental slowing after trihexyphenidyl anticholinergic challenge.
18356633	0	0	An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology/oncology population.
18356633	1	80	Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections.
18356633	2	232	Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population.
18356633	3	448	To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center.
18356633	4	640	Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin.
18356633	5	838	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed.
18356633	6	1017	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00).
18356633	7	1157	Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002).
18356633	8	1283	The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups.
18356633	9	1435	Efficacy could not be assessed.
18363626	0	0	High dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.
18363626	1	66	OBJECTIVE: This large-scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of dexmedetomidine.
18363626	2	166	AIM: To determine the hemodynamic responses, efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.
18363626	3	359	BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies.
18363626	4	495	Over time, an effective protocol utilizing high dose dexmedetomidine as the sole sedative agent has evolved.
18363626	5	604	METHODS/MATERIALS: As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process, data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed.
18363626	6	750	Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received dexmedetomidine for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007.
18363626	7	880	RESULTS: Since 2005, the 10-min loading dose of our dexmedetomidine protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg.kg(-1), and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1.5 to 2 microg.kg(-1).h(-1).
18363626	8	1066	The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation (able to complete the imaging study) when using dexmedetomidine alone from 91.8% to 97.6% (P = 0.009), reducing the requirement for adjuvant pentobarbital in the event of sedation failure with dexmedetomidine alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min (P < 0.001).
18363626	9	1427	Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of bradycardia, all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher.
18363626	10	1647	CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies.
18363626	11	1743	While use of high dose dexmedetomidine is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established 'awake' norms, this deviation is generally within 20% of norms, and is not associated with adverse sequelae.
18363626	12	1977	Dexmedetomidine is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI.
18405372	0	0	Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis: A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events.
18405372	1	139	BACKGROUND: Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are handicapped by under-reporting and limited detail on individual cases.
18405372	2	290	We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients.
18405372	3	511	METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years.
18405372	4	630	Patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified.
18405372	5	737	Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument.
18405372	6	869	The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions.
18405372	7	989	RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance.
18405372	8	1061	Eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant.
18405372	9	1155	All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment.
18405372	10	1211	Seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis.
18405372	11	1294	Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent.
18405372	12	1363	Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six.
18405372	13	1451	Drug-related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients.
18405372	14	1533	The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients.
18405372	15	1642	CONCLUSION: Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.
18441470	0	0	Complete atrioventricular block secondary to lithium therapy.
18441470	1	62	Sinus node dysfunction has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of lithium.
18441470	2	172	In the present case, complete atrioventricular (AV) block with syncopal attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation.
18441470	3	340	Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal attacks.
18441470	4	437	Lithium should be used with extreme caution, especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction.
18483878	0	0	Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout (VIP-/-) mice with cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.
18483878	1	155	Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways.
18483878	2	268	VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis.
18483878	3	415	Given VIP's role as an anti-inflammatory mediator, we hypothesized that VIP(-/-) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cystitis.
18483878	4	573	A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without CYP-induced cystitis (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h).
18483878	5	800	Four binary comparisons were made: WT control versus CYP treatment (48 h), VIP(-/-) control versus CYP treatment (48 h), WT control versus VIP(-/-) control, and WT with CYP treatment (48 h) versus VIP(-/-) with CYP treatment (48 h).
18483878	6	1033	The genes presented represent (1) greater than 1.5-fold change in either direction and (2) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being made.
18483878	7	1185	Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme-linked immunoassays including IL-1beta and CXCL1.
18483878	8	1287	CYP treatment significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased expression of CXCL1 and IL-1beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP(-/-) mice, but expression in VIP(-/-) mice with CYP treatment was significantly (p < or = 0.001) greater (4.2- to 13-fold increase) than that observed in WT urinary bladder (3.6- to 5-fold increase).
18483878	9	1612	The data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation, inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP.
18483878	10	1751	This shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways.
1848636	0	0	Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers.
1848636	1	120	The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type.
1848636	2	243	The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs.
1848636	3	461	We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol.
1848636	4	557	The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia.
1848636	5	650	By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy.
1848636	6	917	Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2.
1848636	7	1186	Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol.
1848636	8	1401	In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%).
1848636	9	1505	Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug.
1848636	10	1626	There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
18513945	0	0	The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.
18513945	1	131	Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus.
18513945	2	261	The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return.
18513945	3	404	Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume.
18513945	4	583	Oxytocin-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss.
18513945	5	678	Pulse power analysis (also called "pulse contour analysis") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure.
18513945	6	942	Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia.
18513945	7	1049	Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output.
18513945	8	1225	Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.
18541230	0	0	Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats.
18541230	1	83	We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome.
18541230	2	289	Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.).
18541230	3	451	Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities.
18541230	4	557	Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed.
18541230	5	650	Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats.
18541230	6	874	In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.
18541230	7	1009	Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased.
18541230	8	1113	These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome.
18541230	9	1251	Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
18589141	0	0	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation.
18589141	1	62	BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation.
18589141	2	259	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%.
18589141	3	405	The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown.
18589141	4	587	PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation.
18589141	5	679	We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3.
18589141	6	781	The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level.
18589141	7	857	HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14.
18589141	8	935	Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks.
18589141	9	982	RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively.
18589141	10	1111	Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable.
18589141	11	1272	In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively.
18589141	12	1455	The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients.
18589141	13	1533	The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14.
18589141	14	1642	None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT.
18589141	15	1699	CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.
18627295	0	0	Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy-induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.
18627295	1	120	Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis.
18627295	2	263	To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy, we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy.
18627295	3	510	DOX control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo.
18627295	4	597	This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT, as well as an increased bax/bcl2 ratio in Western blots, indicating cardiac apoptosis.
18627295	5	744	Furthermore, mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue.
18627295	6	853	In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.
18627295	7	1053	These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis.
18627295	8	1183	These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B1R antagonists for treatment of human DOX cardiomyopathy.
18657397	0	0	Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats.
18657397	1	101	Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research.
18657397	2	177	In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats.
18657397	3	360	Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup.
18657397	4	460	After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded.
18657397	5	676	Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis.
18657397	6	837	Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands.
18657397	7	1027	Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity).
18657397	8	1320	Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.
18674790	0	0	High fat diet-fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
18674790	1	89	Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy.
18674790	2	223	Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
18674790	3	342	This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway.
18674790	4	529	In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
18674790	5	753	A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin/kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity, cardiac dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB) rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity.
18674790	6	1016	Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts.
18674790	7	1181	Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB), (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP-alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP/ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration.
18674790	8	1745	Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK/STAT3 pathway.
18674790	9	1860	In conclusion, HFD-induced obese rats are highly sensitized to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial ATP generation, increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.
18808529	0	0	Isoproterenol induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts: correlation with myocardial injury.
18808529	1	100	The mechanism of isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage is unknown, but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs. demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed.
18808529	2	348	Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by isoproterenol.
18808529	3	485	Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins, this study tests the hypothesis that isoproterenol affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins.
18808529	4	818	We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to isoproterenol subcutaneous administration.
18808529	5	919	Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
18808529	6	1099	The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin.
18808529	7	1184	Subsequently, after lysis of myofilaments, gamma-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, beta1-integrin, and laminin alpha-2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown, as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process.
18808529	8	1400	In conclusion, administration of isoproterenol to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin, the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte.
18808529	9	1639	These changes, related to ischaemic injury, explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by isoproterenol.
188339	0	0	Etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of liver tumors associated with oral contraceptives.
188339	1	91	Within the last several years, previously rare liver tumors have been seen in young women using oral contraceptive steroids.
188339	2	216	The Registry for Liver Tumors Associated with Oral Contraceptives at the University of California, Irvine, has clearly identified 27 cases.
188339	3	356	The recent literature contains 44 case reports.
188339	4	404	Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia, adenoma, hamartoma, and hepatoma.
188339	5	530	Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of oral contraceptive steroids.
188339	6	642	Eight deaths and liver rupture in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon.
1899352	0	0	Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna.
1899352	1	46	A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle.
1899352	2	81	Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna.
1899352	3	204	The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna.
1899352	4	385	Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d.
1899352	5	461	Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d.
1899352	6	547	There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria.
1899352	7	597	At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1).
1899352	8	717	The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion.
1899352	9	889	Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial.
1899352	10	1010	The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria.
1899352	11	1203	The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle.
1899352	12	1393	Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.
18997632	0	0	A case of ventricular tachycardia related to caffeine pretreatment.
18997632	1	68	Suboptimal seizure duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice, especially in older patients with higher seizure thresholds.
18997632	2	220	Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectopy.
18997632	3	418	We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administration.
18997632	4	606	Although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated, the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias.
19058474	0	0	Fatal haemopericardium and gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with warfarin.
19058474	1	118	We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin.
19058474	2	279	We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids, which are present in fruit juices, may increase the potency of warfarin by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate warfarin.
19058474	3	481	While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs, consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions.
19105845	0	0	Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride-induced seizures in mice.
19105845	1	105	BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion-induced seizures.
19105845	2	224	This is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates.
19105845	3	348	METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice.
19105845	4	582	A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group).
19105845	5	800	Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min.
19105845	6	969	The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded.
19105845	7	1083	RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.
19105845	8	1257	Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.
19105845	9	1543	Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min.
19105845	10	1665	CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.
19135948	0	0	Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with everolimus and tacrolimus is associated with a high incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and microangiopathy: results of the EVTAC trial.
19135948	1	189	A calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate is the standard prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
19135948	2	370	Everolimus, a derivative of sirolimus, seems to mediate antileukemia effects.
19135948	3	448	We report on a combination of everolimus and tacrolimus in 24 patients (median age, 62 years) with either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 17) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 7) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related (n = 4) or unrelated (n = 20) donors.
19135948	4	734	All patients engrafted, and only 1 patient experienced grade IV mucositis.
19135948	5	809	Nine patients (37%) developed acute grade II-IV GVHD, and 11 of 17 evaluable patients (64%) developed chronic extensive GVHD.
19135948	6	935	Transplantation-associated microangiopathy (TMA) occurred in 7 patients (29%), with 2 cases of acute renal failure.
19135948	7	1051	The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients (25%) developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), which was fatal in 2 cases.
19135948	8	1204	With a median follow-up of 26 months, the 2-year overall survival rate was 47%.
19135948	9	1284	Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute GVHD, the incidence of TMA and SOS is considerably higher than seen with other regimens.
19139001	0	0	Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and sulindac for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas.
19139001	1	171	A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) plus sulindac or matched placebos.
19139001	2	345	Temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms.
19139001	3	501	The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies.
19139001	4	751	Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies.
19139001	5	1014	In the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 Hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 dB (-0.17 to 2.14 dB; P = 0.09) was detected.
19139001	6	1139	Dose intensity did not add information to models.
19139001	7	1189	There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02).
19139001	8	1433	Follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 dB (-0.81 to 2.96 dB; P = 0.26) between treatment arms.
19139001	9	1625	There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group.
19139001	10	1808	The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; P = 0.12).
19139001	11	1942	There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo.
19203554	0	0	Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(PR3-ANCA) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment.
19203554	1	143	A 59-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes, pleural effusion, eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment.
19203554	2	310	Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement.
19203554	3	448	Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was negative.
19203554	4	626	PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in pleural effusions on right and left side, respectively.
19203554	5	721	Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural effusion remained.
19203554	6	1044	One month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion disappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later.
19203554	7	1157	This case suggests that sulphasalazine can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
19234905	0	0	Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
19234905	1	109	A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed.
19234905	2	336	Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected.
19234905	3	625	All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed.
19234905	4	713	Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
19234905	5	823	Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery.
19234905	6	1070	There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months.
19234905	7	1209	Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group.
19234905	8	1286	Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups.
19234905	9	1376	Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups.
19234905	10	1427	Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day.
19234905	11	1676	The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.
19274460	0	0	DSMM XI study: dose definition for intravenous cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma.
19274460	1	175	A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).
19274460	2	429	Thirty patients were treated with three 21-day cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on the day of bortezomib injection and the day after plus cyclophosphamide at 900, 1,200, or 1,500 mg/m(2) on day 1.
19274460	3	675	The maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide was defined as 900 mg/m(2).
19274460	4	750	At this dose level, 92% of patients achieved at least a partial response.
19274460	5	824	The overall response rate [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] across all dose levels was 77%, with a 10% CR rate.
19274460	6	954	No patient experienced progressive disease.
19274460	7	998	The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as neuropathy.
19274460	8	1105	The results suggest that bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide at 900 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MM that warrants further investigation.
1928887	0	0	Naloxone reversal of hypotension due to captopril overdose.
1928887	1	60	The hemodynamic effects of captopril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system.
1928887	2	197	The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril.
1928887	3	301	We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose, manifested by marked hypotension, that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone.
1928887	4	450	To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of captopril-induced hypotension treated with naloxone.
1928887	5	556	Our experience demonstrates a possible role of naloxone in the reversal of hypotension resulting from captopril.
19289093	0	0	Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated chondroitin sulfate in heparin products.
19289093	1	134	Heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients.
19289093	2	221	Recently, a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion.
19289093	3	456	Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent hypotension in pigs.
19289093	4	609	The no observed effect level (NOEL) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1mg/kg, corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3%.
19289093	5	762	We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in heparin products using a simple, inexpensive, commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0.1%, well below the NOEL.
19289093	6	994	This kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives.
19300240	0	0	5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report.
19300240	1	66	The apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease.
19300240	2	366	Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents.
19300240	3	443	However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents.
19300240	4	518	We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer.
19300240	5	619	A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram.
19300240	6	776	She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer.
19300240	7	862	Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic.
19300240	8	984	Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions.
19300240	9	1047	The patient was stabilized with medical therapy.
19300240	10	1096	Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic.
19300240	11	1151	Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis.
19300240	12	1243	Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm, endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation.
19300240	13	1417	In our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS.
19319147	0	0	Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage.
19319147	1	126	Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a severe type of stroke.
19319147	2	207	There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-ICH.
19319147	3	265	Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume.
19319147	4	429	Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9.
19319147	5	567	First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice.
19319147	6	674	Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum.
19319147	7	783	Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group).
19319147	8	896	Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay.
19319147	9	1020	The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015).
19319147	10	1169	In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL).
19319147	11	1252	In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group.
19319147	12	1323	We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume.
19319147	13	1459	Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-ICH.
19370593	0	0	Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
19370593	1	71	BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women.
19370593	2	281	This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005.
19370593	3	365	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life.
19370593	4	524	SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.
19370593	5	758	Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts.
19370593	6	819	SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.
19370593	7	963	HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes.
19370593	8	1075	DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
19370593	9	1174	MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included.
19370593	10	1242	In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease.
19370593	11	1463	Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.
19370593	12	1718	The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use.
19370593	13	1864	Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia.
19370593	14	2073	Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.
19370593	15	2214	One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups.
19370593	16	2396	The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500.
19370593	17	2569	However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women.
19370593	18	2660	AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.
19370593	19	2749	We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.
19642243	0	0	Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis.
19642243	1	118	Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen.
19642243	2	290	Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule.
19642243	3	436	Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent.
19642243	4	539	Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.
19674115	0	0	Recurrent dysosmia induced by pyrazinamide.
19674115	1	44	Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic toxicity, hyperuricemia or digestive disorders.
19674115	2	146	In rare cases, alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for pyrazinamide when combined with other drugs.
19674115	3	269	We report a case of reversible olfactory disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman, with a positive rechallenge.
19674115	4	384	The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake.
19674115	5	484	Dysosmia disappeared completely after pyrazinamide withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge.
19674115	6	582	The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance.
19692487	0	0	Mice lacking mPGES-1 are resistant to lithium-induced polyuria.
19692487	1	64	Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria.
19692487	2	151	However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated.
19692487	3	253	The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1).
19692487	4	391	A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine.
19692487	5	516	This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion.
19692487	6	621	In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output.
19692487	7	814	Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice.
19692487	8	1032	This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice.
19692487	9	1092	qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex.
19692487	10	1188	Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment.
19692487	11	1366	In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice.
19692487	12	1479	We conclude that mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) mediates lithium-induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression.
1969772	0	0	Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs.
1969772	1	85	The introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy.
1969772	2	302	Specific dopamine-1, (DA1) and dopamine-2 (DA2) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation.
1969772	3	406	Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation.
1969772	4	507	The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested.
1969772	5	624	Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia.
1969772	6	938	Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam (3.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +/- 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (NS).
1969772	7	1164	Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during fenoldopam-induced hypotension 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (P less than 0.01).
1969772	8	1353	Sodium nitroprusside is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension.
1969772	9	1522	Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine-1 (DA1) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension.
19707748	0	0	Seizures associated with levofloxacin: case presentation and literature review.
19707748	1	80	PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin-induced seizures.
19707748	2	378	METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid.
19707748	3	468	The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin.
19707748	4	534	The search was limited to studies published in English.
19707748	5	590	RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature.
19707748	6	680	Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases.
19707748	7	815	CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating levofloxacin therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP1A2 substrates.
19719056	0	0	Dextran-etodolac conjugates: synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
19719056	1	73	Etodolac (E), is a non-narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug.
19719056	2	142	A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of etodolac-dextran conjugates (ED) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects.
19719056	3	331	An activated moiety, i.e. N-acylimidazole derivative of etodolac (EAI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000).
19719056	4	523	IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates.
19719056	5	596	Etodolac contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis.
19719056	6	664	The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark-Howink-Sakurada equation.
19719056	7	766	In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers (pH 1.2, 7.4, 9) and in 80% (v/v) human plasma (pH 7.4).
19719056	8	877	At pH 9, a higher rate of etodolac release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics.
19719056	9	1044	In vivo investigations were performed in animals.
19719056	10	1094	Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic acid induced writhing model (mice) and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, respectively.
19719056	11	1266	In comparison to control, E and ED1-ED4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (p <0.001).
19719056	12	1386	Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates (ED1-ED4) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug--etodolac.
19721134	0	0	The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of pilocarpine on animal models.
19721134	1	89	This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine-induced rat and ouabain-induced guinea pig arrhythmia models.
19721134	2	279	Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes.
19721134	3	397	The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca(2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine.
19721134	4	762	Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine.
19721134	5	946	These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR.
19721134	6	1126	The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca(2+) handling.
19761039	0	0	Effect of Hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats.
19761039	1	107	Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations.
19761039	2	263	The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day.
19761039	3	358	On day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min.
19761039	4	441	Reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of Hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects.
19761039	5	664	Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH), an index of oxidative stress process.
19761039	6	913	Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD, CAT and GSH levels.
19761039	7	1046	The results of the present study suggested that Hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress.
19893084	0	0	Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure.
19893084	1	57	In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels.
19893084	2	294	The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper.
19893084	3	500	Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals.
19893084	4	633	The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium.
19893084	5	814	The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s).
19893084	6	969	Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values.
19893084	7	1058	The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration.
19917396	0	0	Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report.
19917396	1	112	Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation.
19917396	2	203	However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity.
19917396	3	254	Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation.
19917396	4	357	The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography.
19917396	5	521	Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected.
19917396	6	718	The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced.
19917396	7	826	Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.
19917396	8	997	Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy.
19917396	9	1074	In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.
19923525	0	0	Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in adult mice.
19923525	1	97	BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction.
19923525	2	235	We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory.
19923525	3	397	METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention.
19923525	4	479	For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered.
19923525	5	631	Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial.
19923525	6	687	Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone.
19923525	7	897	The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals.
19923525	8	1045	RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s).
19923525	9	1120	Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO, or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively).
19923525	10	1353	A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001).
19923525	11	1485	In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively.
19923525	12	1777	Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg.
19923525	13	1895	The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
19923525	14	1963	PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups, respectively.
19923525	15	2150	There were no significant differences among groups.
19923525	16	2202	CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect.
19923525	17	2416	NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension.
19923525	18	2557	The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.
19940105	0	0	Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.
19940105	1	108	Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).
19940105	2	308	Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known.
19940105	3	488	The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD.
19940105	4	677	Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats.
19940105	5	820	AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats.
19940105	6	939	In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.
19940105	7	1135	In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice.
19940105	8	1297	Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD.
19940105	9	1384	Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity.
19940105	10	1519	Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.
19944333	0	0	Sorafenib-induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm.
19944333	1	76	A 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest.
19944333	2	180	Two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started.
19944333	3	240	He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram.
19944333	4	343	Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction.
19944333	5	424	However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography.
19944333	6	492	Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test.
19944333	7	549	Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib.
19944333	8	704	Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status.
19944333	9	790	We report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm.
19944333	10	859	Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival.
19944333	11	979	On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm.
19944333	12	1087	Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by sorafenib use.
19944736	0	0	A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB.
19944736	1	111	The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound.
19944736	2	407	A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB.
19944736	3	539	Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage.
19944736	4	658	The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats.
19944736	5	899	All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively).
19944736	6	1125	In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals.
19944736	7	1332	Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals.
19944736	8	1423	In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.
19996135	0	0	High-dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients.
19996135	1	105	BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures.
19996135	2	307	These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage.
19996135	3	470	The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery.
19996135	4	631	METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures.
19996135	5	737	Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies.
19996135	6	889	RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients.
19996135	7	1052	All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities.
19996135	8	1130	All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures.
19996135	9	1344	All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass.
19996135	10	1407	No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent.
19996135	11	1513	CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.
2004	0	0	Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs.
2004	1	95	Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants.
2004	2	257	Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman.
2004	3	451	Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine).
2004	4	543	Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman.
2004	5	657	Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients.
2004	6	736	The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one.
2004	7	992	The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped.
2004	8	1095	Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease.
2004	9	1202	Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs.
2004	10	1354	A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.
2004015	0	0	Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in azidothymidine treated immunodeficient mice.
2004015	1	111	The anaemia induced by 3'-azido-3'dideoxythymidine (AZT) is poorly understood.
2004015	2	190	We have used a murine model of AIDS, infection of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukaemia (MuLV) virus, to determine if AZT-induced anaemia is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO).
2004015	3	446	Mice in the early stage of LP-BM5 MuLV disease were given AZT in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/ml.
2004015	4	554	AZT produced anaemia in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion.
2004015	5	620	Despite the anaemia, the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in AZT treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment.
2004015	6	807	Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving AZT for 15 d than for infected, untreated mice.
2004015	7	968	By day 30, sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU-e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals.
2004015	8	1116	The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treated mice.
2004015	9	1282	The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia.
2004015	10	1437	However, reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in AZT treated infected mice.
2004015	11	1545	AZT-induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of BFU-e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation.
20042557	0	0	Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture repair.
20042557	1	138	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative delirium.
20042557	2	333	PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation.
20042557	3	608	Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index (BIS), and patients were randomized to receive either deep (BIS, approximately 50) or light (BIS, >or=80) sedation.
20042557	4	817	Postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery.
20042557	5	1049	RESULTS: From April 2, 2005, through October 30, 2008, a total of 114 patients were randomized.
20042557	6	1145	The prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation.
20042557	7	1411	The mean +/- SD number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group (0.5+/-1.5 days vs 1.4+/-4.0 days; P=.01).
20042557	8	1590	CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation.
20042557	9	1724	Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.
20103708	0	0	The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy.
20103708	1	76	OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
20103708	2	226	Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis.
20103708	3	360	Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy.
20103708	4	459	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells.
20103708	5	733	RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels.
20103708	6	853	In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage.
20103708	7	963	This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice.
20103708	8	1121	Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.
20103708	9	1389	In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes.
20103708	10	1516	Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production.
20103708	11	1735	CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
20164825	0	0	Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway.
20164825	1	100	The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients.
20164825	2	267	Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity.
20164825	3	356	Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration.
20164825	4	548	Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure.
20164825	5	623	This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems.
20164825	6	784	Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration.
20164825	7	885	These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function.
20164825	8	1028	We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores.
20164825	9	1180	These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin.
20164825	10	1326	Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.
20195852	0	0	Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study.
20195852	1	130	Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography.
20195852	2	430	This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis.
20195852	3	702	The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or iohexol (group B, n = 40).
20195852	4	819	Serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use.
20195852	5	997	Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals.
20195852	6	1066	Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population.
20195852	7	1275	Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury.
20195852	8	1471	Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014).
20195852	9	1744	Among the 15 patients with CIN, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243).
20195852	10	1917	Although clinically silent, CIN is not rare in pediatrics.
20195852	11	1976	The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.
2021202	0	0	Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane-induced hypotension in humans.
2021202	1	91	The effect of isoflurane-induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects.
2021202	2	219	Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, respectively.
2021202	3	370	Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane.
2021202	4	450	Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.
2021202	5	608	GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension.
2021202	6	711	Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values.
2021202	7	815	Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow.
2021202	8	959	We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.
20304337	0	0	Brainstem dysgenesis in an infant prenatally exposed to cocaine.
20304337	1	65	Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal cocaine abuse during pregnancy.
20304337	2	157	Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of fetal anomalies.
20304337	3	263	We report on an infant with multiple cranial-nerve involvement attributable to brainstem dysgenesis, born to a cocaine-addicted mother.
20331935	0	0	A cross-sectional evaluation of the effect of risperidone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys.
20331935	1	135	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents.
20331935	2	317	METHOD: Medically healthy 7- to 17-year-old males chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited for this cross-sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007.
20331935	3	559	Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted.
20331935	4	626	The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review, and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record.
20331935	5	755	Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.
20331935	6	948	RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years.
20331935	7	1065	Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia.
20331935	8	1173	As expected, bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity.
20331935	9	1247	After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores, serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius (P < .03).
20331935	10	1438	Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05).
20331935	11	1666	These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white patients.
20331935	12	1765	Of 13 documented fractures, 3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia.
20331935	13	1901	CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents.
20331935	14	2046	Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues.
20394767	0	0	Fear-potentiated startle, but not light-enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs.
20394767	1	91	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced startle paradigm (LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect.
20394767	2	248	In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear.
20394767	3	336	However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar.
20394767	4	415	The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms.
20394767	5	661	METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS.
20394767	6	976	RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values.
20394767	7	1100	Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS.
20394767	8	1283	CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response.
20394767	9	1401	Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.
20466178	0	0	Rosaceiform dermatitis associated with topical tacrolimus treatment.
20466178	1	69	We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea-like dermatitis eruptions while using 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for facial dermatitis.
20466178	2	216	Skin biopsy specimens showed telangiectasia and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis.
20466178	3	352	Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform dermatitis, although many cases have not been reported.
20510337	0	0	Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.
20510337	1	75	The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme Q10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg).
20510337	2	227	Coenzyme Q10 treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for 6 consecutive days, starting 1 day before cisplatin administration.
20510337	3	355	Coenzyme Q10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cisplatin.
20510337	4	473	Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration.
20510337	5	867	Also, histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment.
20510337	6	976	Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme Q10 significantly decreased the cisplatin-induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear factor-kappaB, caspase-3 and p53 in renal tissue.
20510337	7	1187	It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice.
2051906	0	0	Reversible cholestasis with bile duct injury following azathioprine therapy.
2051906	1	77	A case report.
2051906	2	92	A 67-year-old patient, with primary polymyositis and without previous evidence of liver disease, developed clinical and biochemical features of severe cholestasis 3 months after initiation of azathioprine therapy.
2051906	3	306	Liver biopsy showed cholestasis with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts.
2051906	4	418	Azathioprine withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities.
2051906	5	526	It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible azathioprine-induced cholestasis associated with histological evidence of bile duct injury.
20533999	0	0	Dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.
20533999	1	88	It is widely believed that dopamine (DA) mediates methamphetamine (METH)-induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons, because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity, whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity.
20533999	2	350	However, temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain DA neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data.
20533999	3	486	Here we show that the recently reported ability of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine on METH-induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature.
20533999	4	714	Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity, as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved.
20533999	5	874	In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH-induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain.
20533999	6	1076	Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DA is not essential for the development of METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of DA warrant more intense investigation.
20552622	0	0	Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol: case report and review of the literature.
20552622	1	109	CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing.
20552622	2	184	On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events.
20552622	3	336	The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later.
20552622	4	416	The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol.
20552622	5	509	After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared.
20552622	6	606	DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon.
20552622	7	689	Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature.
20552622	8	756	This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT.
20552622	9	884	It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of SIAT, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA).
20552622	10	1105	CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT.
20552622	11	1178	Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.
2055425	0	0	The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus. 1.
2055425	1	150	The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin-diabetic rats were investigated. 2.
2055425	2	286	Diabetes of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment. 3.
2055425	3	519	Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP, and bethanechol. 4.
2055425	4	680	Diabetes of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight, and increases in fluid consumption, urine volume, frequency of micturition, and average volume per micturition, effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study. 5.
2055425	5	954	Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP, and bethanechol. 6.
2055425	6	1109	The data indicate that the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment.
20558148	0	0	Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy.
20558148	1	130	The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system.
20558148	2	348	Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility.
20558148	3	582	However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear.
20558148	4	639	The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats.
20558148	5	857	Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl).
20558148	6	1142	The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.
20558148	7	1372	Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar.
20558148	8	1468	These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.
20635749	0	0	Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report.
20635749	1	101	This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF).
20635749	2	244	To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy.
20635749	3	375	Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment.
20635749	4	486	The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3).
20635749	5	583	Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
20635749	6	763	This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients.
20635749	7	881	The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.
20683499	0	0	Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., crocin on streptozocin-induced model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease in male rats.
20683499	1	136	BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed.
20683499	2	318	In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated.
20683499	3	485	METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups.
20683499	4	663	In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated.
20683499	5	823	In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks.
20683499	6	959	Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days.
20683499	7	1027	However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used.
20683499	8	1179	RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats.
20683499	9	1349	In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test.
20683499	10	1510	CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
20705401	0	0	Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a Japanese population.
20705401	1	105	BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.
20705401	2	251	The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist.
20705401	3	507	In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats.
20705401	4	669	These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders.
20705401	5	877	The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia.
20705401	6	987	Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis.
20705401	7	1096	METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population.
20705401	8	1339	The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients.
20705401	9	1449	RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis.
20705401	10	1558	Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction.
20705401	11	1635	In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively.
20705401	12	1854	CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.
20727411	0	0	Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.
20727411	1	90	The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
20727411	2	206	Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia.
20727411	3	401	In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction.
20727411	4	542	In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected.
20727411	5	763	During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic).
20727411	6	886	Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).
20727411	7	1000	Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology.
20727411	8	1050	Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected.
20727411	9	1259	Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency.
20727411	10	1430	Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions.
20727411	11	1596	Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
20735774	0	0	Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure.
20735774	1	94	BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure remains unknown.
20735774	2	210	AIM: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality.
20735774	3	305	METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004.
20735774	4	470	We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not.
20735774	5	650	RESULTS: We included 641 patients.
20735774	6	685	On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.
20735774	7	1048	These observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure.
20735774	8	1123	More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure.
20735774	9	1292	CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality.
20735774	10	1381	Clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself.
20973483	0	0	In vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A2A/A1 receptor antagonist in animal models of Parkinson's disease.
20973483	1	113	The in vivo characterization of a dual adenosine A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in several animal models of Parkinson's disease is described.
20973483	2	255	Discovery and scale-up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail, highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10.0% to 30.5%.
20973483	3	418	Compound 1 is a potent A(2A)/A(1) receptor antagonist in vitro (A(2A) K(i) = 4.1 nM; A(1) K(i) = 17.0 nM) that has excellent activity, after oral administration, across a number of animal models of Parkinson's disease including mouse and rat models of haloperidol-induced catalepsy, mouse model of reserpine-induced akinesia, rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model of drug-induced rotation, and MPTP-treated non-human primate model.
21294084	0	0	Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats.
21294084	1	131	AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined.
21294084	2	336	The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model.
21294084	3	483	MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes.
21294084	4	568	In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically.
21294084	5	751	In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically.
21294084	6	844	EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum.
21294084	7	1040	RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity.
21294084	8	1185	In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation.
21294084	9	1320	CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges.
21294084	10	1520	These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy.
21418164	0	0	CCNU (lomustine) toxicity in dogs: a retrospective study (2002-07).
21418164	1	68	OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of haematological, renal, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU).
21418164	2	257	DESIGN: The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with CCNU at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated.
21418164	3	443	RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU, 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity.
21418164	4	554	CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma, mast cell tumour, brain tumour, histiocytic tumours and epitheliotropic lymphoma.
21418164	5	694	Throughout treatment, 56.9% of dogs experienced neutropenia, 34.2% experienced anaemia and 14.2% experienced thrombocytopenia.
21418164	6	821	Gastrointestinal toxicosis was detected in 37.8% of dogs, the most common sign of which was vomiting (24.3%).
21418164	7	931	Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively.
21418164	8	1066	The incidence of hepatic failure was 1.2%.
21418164	9	1109	CONCLUSIONS: CCNU-associated toxicity in dogs is common, but is usually not life threatening.
2220369	0	0	Central vein thrombosis and topical dipivalyl epinephrine.
2220369	1	59	A report is given on an 83-year-old female who acquired central vein thrombosis in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with dipivalyl epinephrine for advanced glaucoma discovered in the other eye.
2220369	2	283	From present knowledge about the effects of adrenergic eye drops on ocular blood circulation, it is difficult to suggest an association between the two events, which may be coincidental only.
2257294	0	0	Benzylacyclouridine reverses azidothymidine-induced marrow suppression without impairment of anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity.
2257294	1	137	Increased extracellular concentrations of uridine (Urd) have been reported to reduce, in vitro, azidothymidine (AZT)-induced inhibition of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity.
2257294	2	397	Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration, the ability of benzylacyclouridine (BAU) to effect, in vivo, AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed.
2257294	3	585	This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd-related toxicity.
2257294	4	734	In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis.
2257294	5	1118	When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, BAU reduced AZT-induced marrow toxicity.
2257294	6	1227	In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol/L, BAU possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells.
2257294	7	1411	The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed.
2320800	0	0	Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function.
2320800	1	121	A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast cancer, previously treated with cisplatin, developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with anuria, the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide.
2320800	2	307	Postrenal failure was excluded by echography.
2320800	3	353	A prerenal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension, due to an increasing ascitis, occurring just before anuria.
2320800	4	510	However, correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function.
2320800	5	592	Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies.
2320800	6	664	We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide, occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension.
2320800	7	870	We recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion.
2322844	0	0	Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin D2, E2, or F2 alpha to conscious mice.
2322844	1	114	The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests.
2322844	2	276	Prostaglandin D2 (0.5-3 ng/mouse) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3-60 min period after injection.
2322844	3	409	Prostaglandin E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of prostaglandin D2.
2322844	4	560	Similar results were obtained by acetic acid writhing tests.
2322844	5	621	The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist (greater than or equal to 100 ng) but not by AH6809, a prostanoid EP1-receptor antagonist.
2322844	6	822	Conversely, prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 (greater than or equal to 500 ng) but not by the substance P antagonist.
2322844	7	967	Prostaglandin F2 alpha had little effect on pain responses.
2322844	8	1027	These results demonstrate that both prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin E2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord, but in different ways.
2334179	0	0	D-penicillamine in the treatment of localized scleroderma.
2334179	1	59	Localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children.
2334179	2	224	There is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma.
2334179	3	292	Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D-penicillamine are summarized in this article.
2334179	4	435	This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients.
2334179	5	532	Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children.
2334179	6	730	Joint stiffness and contractures also improved.
2334179	7	778	The dose of D-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months.
2334179	8	928	D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency.
2334179	9	1074	These data suggest that D-penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma.
2339463	0	0	Cerebral sinus thrombosis as a potential hazard of antifibrinolytic treatment in menorrhagia.
2339463	1	94	We describe a 42-year-old woman who developed superior sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis associated with prolonged epsilon-aminocaproic acid therapy for menorrhagia.
2339463	2	272	This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with menorrhagia to promote clotting and reduce blood loss.
2339463	3	383	Although increased risk of thromboembolic disease has been reported during treatment with epsilon-aminocaproic acid, cerebral sinus thrombosis has not been previously described.
2339463	4	561	Careful use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid therapy is recommended.
2343592	0	0	Seizure activity with imipenem therapy: incidence and risk factors.
2343592	1	68	Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or head trauma and no evidence of renal disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem/cilastatin.
2343592	2	268	Neither patient had reported previous seizures or seizure-like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents.
2343592	3	381	All seizures were controlled with therapeutic doses of phenytoin.
2343592	4	447	Both patients had received maximum doses of other beta-lactam antibiotics without evidence of seizure activity.
2422478	0	0	Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa.
2422478	1	93	Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.
2422478	2	339	The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus.
2422478	3	500	In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly.
2422478	4	860	However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension.
2422478	5	1030	Further, 5,7-DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection.
2422478	6	1284	It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.
2435991	0	0	Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias.
2435991	1	87	Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined.
2435991	2	331	Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7).
2435991	3	709	The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias.
2435991	4	833	This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action.
2435991	5	983	Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.
2466960	0	0	Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during fluorouracil therapy: a prospective study.
2466960	1	87	Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion.
2466960	2	257	We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes.
2466960	3	448	Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion.
2466960	4	554	Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion).
2466960	5	634	However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002).
2466960	6	838	The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01).
2466960	7	1151	ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease.
2466960	8	1231	There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course.
2466960	9	1331	We conclude that 5-FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease.
2466960	10	1517	The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined.
2528969	0	0	Nature, time course and dose dependence of zidovudine-related side effects: results from the Multicenter Canadian Azidothymidine Trial.
2528969	1	136	To characterize the nature, time course and dose dependency of zidovudine-related side effects, we undertook a multicenter, prospective, dose-range finding study.
2528969	2	299	Our study group consisted of 74 HIV-positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B, III and IV C2 from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of HIV disease.
2528969	3	473	Following a 3-week observation period, volunteers were treated with zidovudine 600 mg/day for 18 weeks, 900 mg/day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg/day for 9 weeks, followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re-started on 1200 mg/day or the highest tolerated dose at 8-hourly intervals.
2528969	4	770	Subjects were randomly assigned to 4-hourly or 8-hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg/day.
2528969	5	887	Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3-week intervals.
2528969	6	959	Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96% of subjects, most commonly nausea (64%), fatigue (55%) and headache (49%).
2528969	7	1082	These were generally self-limited, reappearing briefly at each dose increment.
2528969	8	1161	A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy.
2528969	9	1232	This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment.
2528969	10	1316	A red blood cell count decrease, a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose-independent fashion, reverting at least partially during the washout phase.
2528969	11	1512	The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg/day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg/day.
2528969	12	1658	Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by megaloblastosis in 95% of 65 specimens at week 18.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2533791	0	0	National project on the prevention of mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis B virus in Japan.
2533791	1	96	In Japan, a nationwide prevention program against mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) started in 1985.
2533791	2	217	This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers.
2533791	3	421	These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine.
2533791	4	574	We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%.
2533791	5	835	The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26%.
2533791	6	892	The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively.
2533791	7	990	Some problems may arise, because 27 to 30% of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas.
2557556	0	0	Involvement of the mu-opiate receptor in peripheral analgesia.
2557556	1	63	The intradermal injection of mu (morphine, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol and morphiceptin), kappa (trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]benzeneactemide) and delta ([D-Pen2.5]-enkephalin and [D-Ser2]-[Leu]enkephalin-Thr) selective opioid-agonists, by themselves, did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat.
2557556	2	440	Intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin E2-induced hyperalgesia.
2557556	3	595	The analgesic effect of the mu-agonist morphine was dose-dependently antagonized by naloxone and prevented by co-injection of pertussis toxin.
2557556	4	738	Morphine did not, however, alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate.
2557556	5	839	We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu-opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger system.
2564649	0	0	Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in the rat.
2564649	1	117	Whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s).
2564649	2	302	We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine.
2564649	3	466	Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles.
2564649	4	730	Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin.
2564649	5	948	Microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation.
2564649	6	1104	It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.
2569282	0	0	Dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced muscle rigidity in the rat.
2569282	1	115	The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs.
2569282	2	261	Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists.
2569282	3	354	Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism.
2569282	4	505	In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat.
2569282	5	657	Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline.
2569282	6	1069	Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment.
2569282	7	1181	Each rat was then injected with alfentanil (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc).
2569282	8	1245	ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline.
2569282	9	1418	In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion.
2569282	10	1511	The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate.
2569282	11	1668	The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2576810	0	0	Some central effects of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine.
2576810	1	61	We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and methoxamine and on the animal behavior in the "behavioral despair" test.
2576810	2	287	A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
2576810	3	431	The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine.
2576810	4	516	The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered methoxamine was not affected by repeated treatment with fluvoxamine.
2576810	5	665	Given three times fluvoxamine had no effect on the immobilization time in the "behavioral despair" test in rats.
2576810	6	778	The results indicate that fluvoxamine given repeatedly acts differently than citalopram, another selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, and differs also from other antidepressant drugs.
2594614	0	0	Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN 52021, on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular impairments in rats.
2594614	1	140	Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively).
2594614	2	366	Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN 52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR.
2594614	3	569	In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective.
2594614	4	714	When BN 52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective.
2594614	5	908	A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021.
2594614	6	1025	Since the administration of BN 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021, a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity.
2594614	7	1291	Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular alterations.
2598570	0	0	The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen.
2598570	1	65	Suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent.
2598570	2	168	Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States.
2598570	3	327	Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported.
2598570	4	401	To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome.
2598570	5	648	Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5).
2598570	6	1048	Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt.
2598570	7	1325	These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance.
2598570	8	1423	These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome: acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules.
2709684	0	0	Phlorizin-induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.
2709684	1	81	Because rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin-induced acute renal failure (ARF).
2709684	2	330	The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P).
2709684	3	510	DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied.
2709684	4	611	Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days.
2709684	5	713	Group 1 (P alone) received P, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (P + gentamicin); Group III (gentamicin alone) and Group IV (mild DM + gentamicin).
2709684	6	861	Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV.
2709684	7	1000	In Group I, P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular necrosis score [maximum 4], zero).
2709684	8	1257	In Group II, P did not prevent gentamicin-ARF (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, P less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1).
2709684	9	1450	These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (P less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; tubular necrosis score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2716967	0	0	Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat.
2716967	1	128	Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat.
2716967	2	234	Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain.
2716967	3	492	The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously.
2716967	4	651	There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine.
2716967	5	825	Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination.
2716967	6	981	Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects.
2716967	7	1032	The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar.
2716967	8	1185	Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine.
2716967	9	1432	While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site.
2722224	0	0	Hydrocortisone-induced hypertension in humans: pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function.
2722224	1	96	Oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects.
2722224	2	203	We studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) on blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, forearm vascular resistance, and norepinephrine spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers.
2722224	3	438	Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged, systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg (SED +/- 3.4, p less than 0.01), associated with an increased cardiac output (5.85-7.73 l/min, SED +/- 0.46, p less than 0.01).
2722224	4	676	Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15.1 to 12.2 mm Hg/l/min (SED +/- 1.03, p less than 0.05).
2722224	5	782	Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged, but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated, the rise in resistance increasing from 10.5 mm Hg/ml/100 ml/min (R units) before treatment to 32.6 R units after treatment (SED +/- 6.4, p less than 0.025).
2722224	6	1061	The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra-arterial norepinephrine (25, 50, and 100 ng/min) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone, increasing from an average of 14.9 +/- 2.4 R units before treatment to 35.1 +/- 5.5 R units after hydrocortisone (SED +/- 6.0, p less than 0.05).
2722224	7	1368	A shift to the left in the dose-response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treatment.
2722224	8	1507	Measurement of resting norepinephrine spillover rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased.
2722224	9	1682	The rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output (presumably due to increased blood volume).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2750819	0	0	Neuromuscular blockade with magnesium sulfate and nifedipine.
2750819	1	62	A patient who received tocolysis with nifedipine developed neuromuscular blockade after 500 mg of magnesium sulfate was administered.
2750819	2	196	This reaction demonstrates that nifedipine can seriously potentiate the toxicity of magnesium.
2750819	3	291	Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined.
2790457	0	0	Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine.
2790457	1	110	The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration.
2790457	2	316	Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures.
2790457	3	480	Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats.
2790457	4	580	Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures.
2790457	5	706	Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures.
2790457	6	834	The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures.
2790457	7	1025	The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens.
2790457	8	1198	The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.
2819587	0	0	Magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to "low-dose" birth control pills.
2819587	1	102	The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral deep venous thrombosis in a 21-year-old white woman are presented.
2819587	2	220	This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes.
2819587	3	333	The only known risk factor was "low-dose" oral contraceptive pills.
2819587	4	401	The magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins, vein of Galen, and straight sinus.
2819587	5	539	The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography.
2826064	0	0	Beta-2-adrenoceptor-mediated hypokalemia and its abolishment by oxprenolol.
2826064	1	76	The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling.
2826064	2	233	Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia, together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs.
2826064	3	389	Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg oxprenolol orally.
2826064	4	569	In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentrations.
2826064	5	720	The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effects.
2826064	6	844	Oxprenolol caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC.
2826064	7	990	In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.
2840807	0	0	A dystonia-like syndrome after neuropeptide (MSH/ACTH) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus.
2840807	1	94	The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit.
2840807	2	286	The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE-mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway.
2840807	3	490	However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder.
2840807	4	1207	These questions are currently being investigated.
2886572	0	0	Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine-induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.
2886572	1	156	The present study examines the effect of 6-day epinephrine treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and epinephrine-treated rats.
2886572	2	397	Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only.
2886572	3	517	However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree.
2886572	4	764	Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged.
2886572	5	845	Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney.
2886572	6	1076	This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade.
2886572	7	1194	Propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group.
2886572	8	1266	Phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group.
2886572	9	1411	In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow.
2886572	10	1514	However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration.
2886572	11	1699	Furthermore, data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.
2893236	0	0	GABA involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental.
2893236	1	95	No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics.
2893236	2	212	In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem.
2893236	3	515	Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain.
2893236	4	886	Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum.
2893236	5	1056	These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action.
2894433	0	0	Diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats.
2894433	1	59	The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats.
2894433	2	143	Intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate.
2894433	3	287	Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1).
2894433	4	399	Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia.
2894433	5	575	However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex).
2894433	6	866	The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.
28952	0	0	Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension: the influence of dietary sodium restriction.
28952	1	163	To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment.
28952	2	433	Chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days.
28952	3	485	Six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet.
28952	4	570	All patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40K).
28952	5	632	The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured.
28952	6	750	In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment.
28952	7	894	In the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13.
28952	8	1088	The normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated.
28952	9	1279	It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.
2907585	0	0	Reversal of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.
2907585	1	85	The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone, reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol.
2907585	2	166	A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy.
2907585	3	332	Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy.
2907585	4	433	Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective.
2907585	5	513	However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.
2917114	0	0	Glycopyrronium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of edrophonium.
2917114	1	90	We have compared, in 60 adult patients, the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 and 10 micrograms kg-1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before edrophonium 1 mg kg-1.
2917114	2	283	Significant differences between the four groups were detected (P less than 0.001).
2917114	3	366	Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg-1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min-1 (95% confidence limits 28-32 beat min-1).
2917114	4	503	Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium, was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium-induced bradycardias.
2917114	5	694	This low dose of glycopyrronium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions.
2980315	0	0	Selective injection of iopentol, iohexol and metrizoate into the left coronary artery of the dog.
2980315	1	98	Induction of ventricular fibrillation and decrease of aortic pressure.
2980315	2	169	In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with iopentol, iohexol and metrizoate in doses of 4 ml, 8 ml and 16 ml.
2980315	3	324	Thirty-six iopentol injections, 35 iohexol injections and 37 metrizoate injections were made.
2980315	4	418	Frequencies of ventricular fibrillation were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) after iopentol (0%) and iohexol (3%) than after metrizoate (22%).
2980315	5	568	Iopentol and iohexol also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than metrizoate at the different doses.
3001299	0	0	Thyroid function and urine-concentrating ability during lithium treatment.
3001299	1	75	It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment.
3001299	2	251	We measured serum thyroxine and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving lithium.
3001299	3	388	Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium.
3001299	4	463	Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well.
3001299	5	593	It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different.
3015327	0	0	Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental isoniazid neuropathy in the rat.
3015327	1	80	The neuropathy caused by a single dose of isoniazid in rats was studied with a computer-assisted morphometric method.
3015327	2	198	Scatter diagrams of the g ratio (quotient fibre diameter/axon diameter) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population, distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre.
3015327	3	419	There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population, causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath.
3057041	0	0	Multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups efficacy and safety trial of azelastine, chlorpheniramine, and placebo in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis.
3057041	1	175	Azelastine, a novel antiallergic medication, was compared with chlorpheniramine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups study.
3057041	2	414	One hundred fifty-five subjects participated.
3057041	3	460	Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of spring allergic rhinitis, confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens.
3057041	4	630	Medications were given four times daily; the azelastine groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily.
3057041	5	856	Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4-week treatment period while subjects received study medications.
3057041	6	1037	Individual symptoms, total symptoms, and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication.
3057041	7	1144	Elicited, volunteered, and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups.
3057041	8	1258	Vital signs, body weights, serum chemistry values, complete blood cell counts, urine studies, and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups.
3057041	9	1433	Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of azelastine (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study.
3057041	10	1616	Lower doses of azelastine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study.
3057041	11	1745	In contrast, although the chlorpheniramine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study, the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study.
3057041	12	1943	There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups.
3057041	13	2010	Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose azelastine group.
3057041	14	2132	Azelastine appears to be a safe, efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis.
3084782	0	0	Toxicity due to remission inducing drugs in rheumatoid arthritis.
3084782	1	66	Association with HLA-B35 and Cw4 antigens.
3084782	2	109	Twenty-five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed toxicity while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without toxicity were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens.
3084782	3	319	A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin (a D-Penicillamine like compound) and class I antigens B35-Cw4, and between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35.
3084782	4	526	Compared to healthy controls a lower DR5 frequency was observed in patients with RA except for the Tiopronin related nephritis group.
3088349	0	0	Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine.
3088349	1	160	Following unilateral 6-OHDA induced SN lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling.
3088349	2	319	In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior.
3088349	3	509	Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion.
3088349	4	596	Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons.
3088349	5	759	A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation.
3088349	6	974	However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections.
3088349	7	1323	These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation.
3108839	0	0	Mitomycin C associated hemolytic uremic syndrome.
3108839	1	50	Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised.
3108839	2	186	It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent.
3108839	3	380	The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema.
3108839	4	545	Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis.
3108839	5	774	The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage.
3108839	6	860	We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema.
3115150	0	0	Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity.
3115150	1	69	Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil.
3115150	2	284	Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity.
3115150	3	455	Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline.
3115150	4	646	Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil.
3115150	5	758	Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone.
3115150	6	990	Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone.
3115150	7	1174	These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways.
3115150	8	1377	Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.
3120485	0	0	Antagonism of diazepam-induced sedative effects by Ro15-1788 in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural block.
3120485	1	116	A double-blind placebo-controlled investigation of efficacy and safety.
3120485	2	188	The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of Ro15-1788 and a placebo in reversing diazepam-induced effects after surgery under epidural block, and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of Ro15-1788.
3120485	3	407	Fifty-seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaesthesia.
3120485	4	495	Antagonism of diazepam-induced effects by Ro15-1788 was investigated postoperatively in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
3120485	5	624	The patient's subjective assessment of mood rating, an objective test of performance, a test for amnesia, and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug.
3120485	6	818	No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating, amnesia, or vital signs.
3120485	7	924	The Ro15-1788 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug.
3120485	8	1049	There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site.
3123611	0	0	Chorea associated with oral contraception.
3123611	1	43	Three patients developed chorea while receiving oral contraceptives.
3123611	2	112	Two were young patients whose chorea developed long after treatment had been started and disappeared soon after it had been discontinued.
3123611	3	250	The third patient had acute amphetamine-induced chorea after prolonged oral contraception.
3123611	4	341	Prolonged administration of female sex hormones is a possible cause of chorea in women who have not previously had chorea or rheumatic fever.
3131282	0	0	Co-carcinogenic effect of retinyl acetate on forestomach carcinogenesis of male F344 rats induced with butylated hydroxyanisole.
3131282	1	129	The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined.
3131282	2	270	Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with RA at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks.
3131282	3	464	In groups given 2% BHA, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma) in the group given RA-free water.
3131282	4	845	In rats given 1% BHA, RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA-induced epithelial hyperplasia.
3131282	5	1026	Tumors, all papillomas, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration.
3131282	6	1147	RA alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach.
3131282	7	1212	These findings indicate that RA acted as a co-carcinogen in the BHA forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat.
3137399	0	0	A prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin C.
3137399	1	85	Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin.
3137399	2	214	Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known.
3137399	3	295	We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects.
3137399	4	377	Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated.
3137399	5	454	All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations.
3137399	6	632	The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level.
3137399	7	686	One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin.
3137399	8	785	The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test.
3137399	9	874	None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change.
3137399	10	975	The literature on this subject was also reviewed.
3137399	11	1025	Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin.
3137399	12	1296	The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group.
3183120	0	0	Reversible cerebral lesions associated with tiazofurin usage: MR demonstration.
3183120	1	80	Tiazofurin is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation.
3183120	2	175	We report our results with magnetic resonance (MR) in demonstrating reversible cerebral abnormalities concurrent with the use of this drug.
3183120	3	315	The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography.
3183120	4	413	The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated.
3220106	0	0	Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine-treated rats.
3220106	1	98	Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days.
3220106	2	305	At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum.
3220106	3	553	We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day.
3220106	4	717	In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum.
3220106	5	999	The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected.
3220106	6	1068	In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated.
3220106	7	1185	However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal.
3220106	8	1387	These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.
326460	0	0	Amelioration of bendrofluazide-induced hypokalemia by timolol.
326460	1	63	The beta adrenergic blocking drug, timolol, tended to correct the hypokalemia of short-term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant.
326460	2	261	Timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following bendrofluazide and increased the urine sodium/potassium ratio.
326460	3	416	There was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space.
3300918	0	0	St. Anthony's fire, then and now: a case report and historical review.
3300918	1	71	A rare case of morbid vasospasm, together with striking angiographic findings, is described secondary to the ingestion of methysergide by a 48-year-old woman.
3300918	2	230	A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented.
3300918	3	294	A discussion of the history of ergot includes its original discovery, the epidemics of gangrene that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of migraine headache.
3300918	4	496	Despite the advent of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic antagonists, ergot preparations continue to play a major role in migraine therapy, so that the danger of St. Anthony's fire persists.
3311455	0	0	Cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol.
3311455	1	98	The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients.
3311455	2	261	In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml.
3311455	3	434	In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week.
3311455	4	602	Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels.
3311455	5	728	Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine.
3311455	6	848	Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine.
3311455	7	951	We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.
33969	0	0	Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism.
33969	1	67	In a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients.
33969	2	239	Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine, their previous antiparkinsonian drug.
33969	3	420	However, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients.
33969	4	650	This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.
3411101	0	0	Quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate-induced fulminant hepatitis in a pregnant woman.
3411101	1	82	A case report.
3411101	2	97	We report the case of a 19-year-old Laotian patient affected by fulminant hepatitis during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1-month administration of quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate.
3411101	3	293	After delivery, the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.
3411101	4	365	The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation.
3411101	5	438	Quinidine itself or phenylethylbarbiturate may be responsible for fulminant hepatitis in this patient.
3413271	0	0	Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine: comparison with exercise-induced ischemia.
3413271	1	101	The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease.
3413271	2	213	Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise.
3413271	3	365	Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina.
3413271	4	474	However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise.
3413271	5	597	Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product.
3413271	6	923	These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.
3431591	0	0	Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717).
3431591	1	127	CB 3717, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme.
3431591	2	308	Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates.
3431591	3	406	Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses.
3431591	4	644	As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity.
3431591	5	886	In early clinical studies with CB 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma.
3431591	6	1011	Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity.
3431591	7	1090	This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions.
3431591	8	1247	In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way.
3431591	9	1365	Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients.
3431591	10	1527	Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects.
3431591	11	1596	Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients.
3431591	12	1656	Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.
343678	0	0	Type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure: prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin.
343678	1	91	Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study.
343678	2	154	Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-positive donors.
343678	3	422	Clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001).
343678	4	609	Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients.
343678	5	699	Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (HBeAg; anti-HBE).
343678	6	806	Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg-positive donors.
343678	7	927	Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups.
343678	8	1095	The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.
3461217	0	0	Production of autochthonous prostate cancer in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and testosterone.
3461217	1	126	More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable prostate adenocarcinomas (PAs) following treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea (CAS: 684-93-5) and testosterone propionate [(TP) CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the tumor-bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions.
3461217	2	412	The incubation periods averaged 10.6 months.
3461217	3	457	Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable PA when treated only with TP.
3461217	4	554	In L-W rats, TP acted as a tumor enhancement agent, with primary emphasis on the development of prostate cancer.
3535719	0	0	Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients.
3535719	1	82	We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections.
3535719	2	283	The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious.
3535719	3	336	Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%).
3535719	4	449	Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients.
3535719	5	587	Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and piperacillin-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients.
3535719	6	809	The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin- vs tobramycin and piperacillin-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115).
3535719	7	1105	We conclude that aminoglycoside-associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin.
3653576	0	0	Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidney.
3653576	1	97	Acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (HCBD), puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN), and 2-bromoethylamine (BEA), respectively.
3653576	2	353	Several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity, the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine samples.
3653576	3	547	Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by PAN.
3653576	4	682	The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion, especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 Da.
3653576	5	824	In contrast, protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weights.
3653576	6	979	Proximal tubular damage caused by HCBD and papillary damage caused by BEA were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis (volume and specific gravity) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes.
3653576	7	1181	Alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage.
3653576	8	1364	It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage.
3670965	0	0	A catch in the Reye.
3670965	1	21	Twenty-six cases of Reye syndrome from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed.
3670965	2	155	Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of Reye syndrome.
3670965	3	280	Aspirin or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%).
3670965	4	445	Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of Reye syndrome was accomplished in 90% of the cases.
3670965	5	541	The incidence of Reye syndrome in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain.
3670965	6	823	The mortality for these Reye syndrome cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States.
3670965	7	952	In Australia, the pediatric usage of aspirin has been extremely low for the past 25 years (less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with paracetamol (acetaminophen) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market.
3670965	8	1177	Reye syndrome may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with salicylates or aspirin ingestion, since there were no cases found at The Children's Hospital in 1983, 1984, or 1985.
3686155	0	0	Postpartum psychosis induced by bromocriptine.
3686155	1	47	Two multigravida patients with no prior psychiatric history were seen with postpartum psychosis, having received bromocriptine for inhibition of lactation.
3686155	2	203	Bromocriptine given in high doses has been associated with psychosis in patients receiving the drug for Parkinson's disease.
3686155	3	328	These cases demonstrate that bromocriptine may cause psychosis even when given in low doses.
3703509	0	0	Hyperglycemic acidotic coma and death in Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
3703509	1	64	This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long-standing Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
3703509	2	180	Following short exposure to oral prednisone, both boys developed lethargy, increasing somnolence, polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria.
3703509	3	316	Both presented in the emergency room with profound coma, hypotension, severe hyperglycemia, and acidosis.
3703509	4	422	Nonketotic lactic acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other.
3703509	5	542	Respiratory failure rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation.
3703509	6	641	We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic metabolic-endocrine failure in the Kearns-Sayre syndrome.
3708922	0	0	Experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity: risk of concomitant chemotherapy.
3708922	1	76	The role of cyclosporine (CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats.
3708922	2	222	Administration of 20 mg/kg/day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man.
3708922	3	350	The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model.
3708922	4	644	Gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased CSA nephrotoxicity.
3708922	5	710	Thus, the nephrotoxicity induced by CSA has a different pathogenetic mechanism.
3732088	0	0	Diuretics, potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease.
3732088	1	71	It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias.
3732088	2	184	If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible.
3732088	3	272	Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study.
3732088	4	573	Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy.
3732088	5	699	Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens.
3732088	6	854	Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.
3732088	7	1237	The above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.
3762968	0	0	Transketolase abnormality in tolazamide-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy.
3762968	1	75	We studied a thiamine-dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke's encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide, in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)], as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
3762968	2	425	In addition to this patient, we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kindreds without any history of Wernicke's encephalopathy and from four normal controls.
3762968	3	591	We found that the above-mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke's encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP.
3762968	4	771	These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and the patient with tolazamide-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality.
3769769	0	0	Bradycardia due to trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride.
3769769	1	50	A chronic schizophrenic patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride.
3769769	2	155	The patient developed, paradoxically, sinus bradycardia.
3769769	3	212	The reaction was specific to trihexyphenidyl and not to other anticholinergic drugs.
3769769	4	297	This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical psychiatric practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect.
3780697	0	0	Post-operative rigidity after fentanyl administration.
3780697	1	55	A case of thoraco-abdominal rigidity leading to respiratory failure is described in the post-operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of fentanyl.
3780697	2	229	This was successfully reversed by naloxone.
3780697	3	273	The mechanisms possibly implicated in this accident are discussed.
3780814	0	0	Anti-carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat.
3780814	1	99	The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (PB: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day).
3780814	2	322	Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis.
3780814	3	459	After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks.
3780814	4	645	The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats.
3780814	5	826	When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters.
3780814	6	933	In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone.
3780814	7	1072	It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN.
3780814	8	1236	This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions.
3780814	9	1346	Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' PB effect.
384871	0	0	Bilateral optic neuropathy due to combined ethambutol and isoniazid treatment.
384871	1	79	The case of a 40-year-old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with ethambutol and isoniazid is reported.
384871	2	233	A bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic scotoma was found.
384871	3	333	Ethambutol was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed.
384871	4	414	Isoniazid was discontinued later, followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity.
384871	5	505	The hazards of optic nerve toxicity due to ethambutol are known.
384871	6	570	We emphasize the potential danger in the use of ethambutol and isoniazid.
3934126	0	0	A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy.
3934126	1	77	A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vancomycin was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16-month period.
3934126	2	208	Vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection.
3934126	3	277	Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these vancomycin was considered the likely cause.
3934126	4	403	Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry).
3934126	5	581	Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin.
3934126	6	757	We conclude that vancomycin, administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
3950060	0	0	Factors associated with nephrotoxicity and clinical outcome in patients receiving amikacin.
3950060	1	92	Data from 60 patients treated with amikacin were analyzed for factors associated with nephrotoxicity.
3950060	2	194	In 42 of these patients, data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome.
3950060	3	284	Variables evaluated included patient weight, age, sex, serum creatinine level, creatinine clearance, duration of therapy, total dose, mean daily dose, organism minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), mean peak levels, mean trough levels, mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), total AUC, mean AUC greater than MIC, total AUC greater than MIC, mean Schumacher's intensity factor (IF), total IF, In (mean maximum concentration [Cmax]/MIC).
3950060	4	741	Model-dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one-compartment model.
3950060	5	846	When the parameters were examined individually, duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly (P less than .05) with nephrotoxicity.
3950060	6	992	In contrast, a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy (P less than .001) as an important factor.
3950060	7	1126	Based on this model and on Bayes' theorem, the predictive accuracy of identifying "nephrotoxic" patients increased from 0.17 to 0.39.
3950060	8	1260	When examined individually, mean IF, MIC, total dose, mean daily dose, and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) correlated significantly (P less than .05) with cure.
3950060	9	1408	In contrast, a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF, MIC, and total dose according to one model and ln (mean Cmax/MIC) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value.
3950060	10	1643	Based on Bayes' theorem and the first model, the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0.19 to 0.83.
3950060	11	1775	For the second model, the predictive accuracy increased from 0.19 to 0.50.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

3952818	1	36	Report of a case of spontaneous angina.
3952818	2	76	We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration.
3952818	3	217	Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's angina, and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine.
3952818	4	360	These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5-FU, and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5-FU cardiotoxicity.
3961813	0	0	Dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy in chickens.
3961813	1	130	Tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate (TOTP), 360 mg/kg, po, and 0,0'-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), 1 mg/kg sc, were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm corticosterone.
3961813	2	367	Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed neuropathy appeared.
3961813	3	466	Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP-induced neuropathy, greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP.
3961813	4	692	Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds.
3961813	5	836	Chickens given 200 ppm corticosterone without TOTP or DFP had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase.
3961813	6	1019	Degenerating myelinated fibers were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given TOTP or DFP.
3962737	0	0	Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone.
3962737	1	30	Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias.
3962737	2	133	The use of amiodarone has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects.
3962737	3	215	A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given.
3962737	4	358	It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver.
3962737	5	576	Patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels.
3962737	6	674	Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly.
3969369	0	0	Promotional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rats.
3969369	1	112	Germfree (GF) Lobund strain Wistar (LW) rats, fed vegetable diet L-485, have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously (10% incidence) at average age 34 months.
3969369	2	280	Conventional LW rats, implanted with testosterone at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross tumors, and 40% when it included microscopic tumors.
3969369	3	512	Preliminary results indicate that testosterone-treated LW rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed prostate cancer after intervals of 6-12 months.
3969369	4	714	Aged GF Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats have not developed prostate cancer spontaneously.
3969369	5	797	Conventional SD rats fed diet L-485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis.
3969369	6	891	Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer.
3973521	0	0	Time course alterations of QTC interval due to hypaque 76.
3973521	1	59	Sequential measurement of QT interval during left ventricular angiography was made 30 seconds and one, three, five and ten minutes after injection of hypaque 76.
3973521	2	221	The subjects were ten patients found to have normal left ventricles and coronary arteries.
3973521	3	312	Significant QTC prolongation occurred in 30 seconds to one minute in association with marked hypotension and elevation of cardiac output.
4038130	0	0	Rat extraocular muscle regeneration.
4038130	1	37	Repair of local anesthetic-induced damage.
4038130	2	80	Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery (0.75% bupivacaine hydrochloride, 2.0% mepivacaine hydrochloride, and 2.0% lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1:100,000 epinephrine) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes.
4038130	3	323	Controls were injected with physiological saline.
4038130	4	373	All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles.
4038130	5	453	Muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers.
4038130	6	531	In addition to muscle damage, severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine.
4038130	7	683	With these findings in rats, it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic-induced damage to the extraocular muscles.
4069770	0	0	Gentamicin nephropathy in a neonate.
4069770	1	37	The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of acute renal failure after therapy with gentamicin (5 mg/kg/day) and penicillin are presented.
4069770	2	197	The serum gentamicin concentration had reached toxic levels when anuria developed.
4069770	3	280	Numerous periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive, diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules.
4069770	4	507	The pathological changes induced by gentamicin in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported.
4090988	0	0	Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat.
4090988	1	66	Effects on hepatocyte fine structure.
4090988	2	104	Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months.
4090988	3	244	At the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence.
4090988	4	378	These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats.
4090988	5	543	Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups, and three rats bore bladder carcinomas.
4090988	6	685	However, significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males.
4090988	7	798	Additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi.
4090988	8	962	A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding.
4090988	9	1050	An electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.
430165	0	0	Transient hemiparesis: a rare manifestation of diphenylhydantoin toxicity.
430165	1	75	Report of two cases.
430165	2	96	Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH) overdose, the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar dysfunction.
430165	3	251	Very rarely, the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin.
430165	4	339	Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose.
430165	5	424	Both had brain surgery before DPH treatment.
430165	6	469	It is assumed that patients with some cerebral damage are liable to manifest DPH toxicity as focal neurological signs.
458486	0	0	Tiapride in levodopa-induced involuntary movements.
458486	1	52	Tiapride, a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide, reduced levodopa-induced peak dose involuntary movements in 16 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
458486	2	241	However, an unacceptable increase in disability from Parkinsonism with aggravation of end-of-dose akinesia led to its cessation in 14 patients.
458486	3	385	Tiapride had no effect on levodopa-induced early morning of "off-period" segmental dystonia.
458486	4	478	These results fail to support the notion that levodopa-induced dyskinesias are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of dopamine receptors.
48362	0	0	Quinidine hepatitis.
48362	1	21	Long-term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase.
48362	2	186	Liver biopsy showed active hepatitis.
48362	3	224	Discontinuance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function tests.
48362	4	306	A challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid dehydrogenase values.
48362	5	451	We concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation.
48362	6	593	This report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the hepatic toxicity is reversible.
591536	0	0	Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
591536	1	138	Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy.
591536	2	221	Characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter.
591536	3	505	The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications.
591536	4	704	Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed.
591536	5	805	The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin-induced platelet aggregation.
591536	6	910	Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin, and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necessary.
591536	7	1027	Vascular procedures are performed as indicated.
6111982	0	0	Pharmacology of GYKI-41 099 (chlorpropanol, Tobanum) a new potent beta-adrenergic antagonist.
6111982	1	94	The compound GYKI-41 099, as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, is 3-8 times more potent than propranolol in vitro and in vivo.
6111982	2	217	Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of propranolol and pindolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cats.
6111982	3	345	GYKI-41 900 has a negligible cardiodepressant activity; it is not cardioselective.
6111982	4	428	The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect.
6111982	5	480	There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of 14C-41 099 to rats and dogs.
6111982	6	587	The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours.
6115999	0	0	Adverse reactions to bendrofluazide and propranolol for the treatment of mild hypertension.
6115999	1	92	Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate Hypertension.
6115999	2	175	Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: bendrofluazide, propranolol, or a placebo for either of these drugs.
6115999	3	383	The trial is single-blind. 23 582 patient-years of observation have been completed so far, 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos.
6115999	4	521	The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence, and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos.
6115999	5	707	Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired glucose tolerance in men and women and gout in men, associated with bendrofluazide treatment, and Raynaud's phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol.
6115999	6	956	No corneal disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group.
6115999	7	1027	Mean serum potassium level fell, and urea and uric acid levels rose, in men and women taking bendrofluazide.
6115999	8	1136	In the propranolol group, serum potassium and uric acid levels rose in both sexes, but the urea level rose significantly in women only.
6118280	0	0	Serotonergic drugs, benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol-induced myoclonic jerks in a strain of mice.
6118280	1	109	In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic jerks.
6118280	2	164	A 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min.
6118280	3	312	Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect.
6118280	4	517	However, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect.
6118280	5	592	In doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist MK-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol.
6118280	6	716	Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks.
6118280	7	869	While (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property.
6118280	8	1000	Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition.
6118280	9	1286	Our present study indicated the possible value of MK-212 and (-)-baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus.
6127992	0	0	Adverse interaction between beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil--report of three cases.
6127992	1	97	Three patients with ischaemic heart disease developed profound cardiac failure, hypotension and bradycardia during combined therapy with verapamil and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
6127992	2	280	This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy.
6127992	3	362	Baseline left ventricular function, assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography, was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other.
6127992	4	523	Simultaneously administration of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution.
6150641	0	0	Comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states.
6150641	1	138	The H2-histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states.
6150641	2	363	Nineteen patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion.
6150641	3	500	The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same.
6150641	4	577	The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion.
6150641	5	761	However, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine).
6150641	6	963	Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine.
6150641	7	1139	Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy.
6150641	8	1496	The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states.
6150641	9	1615	Both are safe at high doses, but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine.
6153967	0	0	Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation.
6153967	1	73	Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported.
6153967	2	165	In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures.
6153967	3	278	Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants.
6153967	4	398	Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication.
6153967	5	501	Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free.
6153967	6	617	Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG.
6153967	7	727	On the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.
6203632	0	0	Development of isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
6203632	1	58	The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISO) (0.3 mg/kg body weight).
6203632	2	225	A time course was established for the change in tissue mass, RNA and DNA content, as well as hydroxyproline content.
6203632	3	342	Heart weight increased 44% after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 days.
6203632	4	425	Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26% after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy.
6203632	5	556	The half time for RNA accumulation was 2.0 days.
6203632	6	605	The total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46% after 4 days of therapy.
6203632	7	737	Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage (1-4 days) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady-state level 19% above the controls after 8 days of treatment.
6203632	8	924	Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertrophy.
6203632	9	1071	However, dP/dt in the ISO-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated.
6203632	10	1172	These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA.
6203632	11	1377	However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart.
6216862	0	0	Multiple side effects of penicillamine therapy in one patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
6216862	1	89	Skin rashes, proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis and myasthenia gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
6216862	2	284	A patient who had developed all 5 is now described.
6216862	3	336	The skin lesion resembled elastosis perforans serpiginosa, which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with Wilson's disease but not in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine.
625456	0	0	Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations.
625456	1	45	One case of acute hypercalcaemia and two of recurrent nephrolithiasis are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of calcium carbon-ate-sodium bicarbonate powders for more than 20 years.
625456	2	254	The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients' medical practitioners.
625456	3	349	It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient's problems, and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable.
6292680	0	0	Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left-sided Wilms tumor.
6292680	1	68	Two children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin.
6292680	2	240	The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle.
6292680	3	446	It is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with Wilms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation.
6293644	0	0	Effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system: behavioral and biochemical data.
6293644	1	91	The effects of i.v.c. injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system, were investigated in male rats.
6293644	2	271	Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine-induced hyperactivity.
6293644	3	415	Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal DA and DOPAC concentration or GAD activity.
6293644	4	559	The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the DA-related behavioral messages of striatal origin.
6308526	0	0	Naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory, temperature, and behavioral effects of morphine.
6308526	1	101	Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone, an antagonist of high-affinity mu 1 opioid receptors.
6308526	2	288	Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia, catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes.
6308526	3	465	Moreover, naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine-induced hypotension and respiratory depression, whereas morphine-induced bradycardia was less affected.
6308526	4	628	Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine.
6323692	0	0	Modification of drug action by hyperammonemia.
6323692	1	47	Pretreatment with ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine-treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam, but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect.
6323692	2	288	Thus, hyperammonemia is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease.
6323692	3	461	Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced catecholamine release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac.
6323692	4	693	Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac.
6323692	5	849	These results suggested that ammonia blocks calcium channels.
6323692	6	911	Parallels in the actions of NH4Ac and the calcium channel blocker verapamil support this concept.
6323692	7	1009	Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol.
6323692	8	1265	The data suggest that hyperammonemia exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.
6381653	0	0	Levodopa-induced dyskinesia and thalamotomy.
6381653	1	45	Levodopa-induced dyskinesia of the limbs in thirteen cases of Parkinsonism, which was choreic, ballistic or dystonic in type, was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus.
6381653	2	384	Control of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by thalamic lesions in the course of routine treatment of Parkinsonism is discussed.
6402369	0	0	Treatment of ifosfamide-induced urothelial toxicity by oral administration of sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (MESNA) to patients with inoperable lung cancer.
6402369	1	162	The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (MESNA) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide (IF) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle.
6402369	2	507	MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with IF in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of IF), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria and no episodes of gross haematuria.
6402369	3	801	In this group of 45 patients under protection with MESNA there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (total 31%).
6402369	4	929	A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with IF were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis).
6402369	5	1085	In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of bladder irritation (cystitis and pollakisuria).
6402369	6	1284	There were no appreciable differences between the MESNA series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment.
6402369	7	1475	Our results support the view that MESNA, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include IF, simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium.
6402369	8	1681	Protection with oral MESNA is particularly suitable for outpatients.
6415512	0	0	Myoclonic, atonic, and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children.
6415512	1	100	Five children, aged 3 to 11 years, treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy, had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic, atypical absence and/or atonic (minor motor) seizures within a few days.
6415512	2	321	When the carbamazepine was discontinued, two of the children returned to their former state very quickly, two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months, and one had the seizures persist.
6415512	3	521	The child in whom the seizures persisted was later found to have ceroid lipofuscinosis.
6415512	4	609	The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants.
6433367	0	0	Effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats.
6433367	1	93	To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (PGs) to seizure induction, the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl, picrotoxin, pentetrazol (PTZ), electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated.
6433367	2	327	Ibuprofen, sulindac, mefenamic acid, and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency-to-onset in the flurothyl and/or PTZ models; the electroshock, picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents.
6433367	3	581	These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying fluorthyl- and PTZ-induced convulsions, but not picrotoxin-, electroshock-, or bicuculline-induced convulsions.
6436733	0	0	Acute changes of blood ammonia may predict short-term adverse effects of valproic acid.
6436733	1	88	Valproic acid (VPA) was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs.
6436733	2	206	A standardized loading dose of VPA was administered, and venous blood was sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours.
6436733	3	316	Ammonia (NH3) was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of drowsiness (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although VPA plasma levels were similar in both groups.
6436733	4	530	By measuring VPA-induced changes of blood NH3 content, it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when VPA is given chronically.
6454943	0	0	Effect of captopril on pre-existing and aminonucleoside-induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
6454943	1	112	Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients.
6454943	2	190	The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR.
6454943	3	284	Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR.
6454943	4	395	Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR.
6454943	5	536	Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption.
6454943	6	741	However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR.
6496797	0	0	Complete heart block following a single dose of trazodone.
6496797	1	59	Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone, a patient developed complete heart block.
6496797	2	168	The case illustrates that, despite the results of earlier studies, trazodone's effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay.
6504332	0	0	Phenobarbital-induced dyskinesia in a neurologically-impaired child.
6504332	1	69	A 2-year-old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures.
6504332	2	200	Known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evaluation.
6504332	3	269	On repeat challenge with phenobarbital, the dyskinesia recurred.
6504332	4	334	Phenobarbital should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause movement disorders.
6540303	0	0	Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine catatonia in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals.
6540303	1	101	The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat.
6540303	2	292	In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not.
6540303	3	453	The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions.
6540303	4	501	Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick.
6540303	5	707	Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, melatonin did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so.
6540303	6	919	This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat.
6540303	7	1117	In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by melatonin.
6540303	8	1239	Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia rather than directly on the pituitary.
6615052	0	0	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage.
6615052	1	62	Sixty-two patients with a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are reported.
6615052	2	135	Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or, more frequently, thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin.
6615052	3	269	Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count, increased resistance to heparin, and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when heparin is added.
6615052	4	436	Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin-dependent platelet membrane antibody.
6615052	5	537	The 20 deaths, 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder.
6615052	6	697	Specific risk factors have not been identified; therefore, all patients receiving heparin should be monitored.
6615052	7	808	If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving heparin, platelet aggregation testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated.
6615052	8	974	Management consists of cessation of heparin, platelet anti-aggregating agents, and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated.
663266	0	0	Ventricular fibrillation from diatrizoate with and without chelating agents.
663266	1	77	The toxicity of Renografin 76% was compared with that of Hypaque 76% by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs.
663266	2	217	Renografin contains the chelating agents sodium citrate and disodium edetate, while Hypaque contains calcium disodium edetate and no sodium citrate.
663266	3	366	Ventricular fibrillation occurred significantly more often with Renografin, suggesting that chelating agents contribute to toxicity in coronary angiography.
6637851	0	0	Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.
6637851	1	121	Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.
6637851	2	326	The loading dose was 800 mg/day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg/day.
6637851	3	411	Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2).
6637851	4	630	Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug.
6637851	5	820	One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51% of patients.
6637851	6	884	Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41% and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10% of patients.
6637851	7	1006	The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%).
6637851	8	1219	Although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients.
6637851	9	1423	However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with amiodarone.
6674249	0	0	Why may epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) induce myopathy in man?
6674249	1	65	Report of a case and literature review.
6674249	2	105	A case of necrotizing myopathy due to a short epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) treatment in a 72 year-old patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is described.
6674249	3	269	Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed.
6695415	0	0	Cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine.
6695415	1	86	Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke.
6695415	2	191	It is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and "look-alike" pills.
6695415	3	271	In order to determine if PPA/caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and/or hypertensive rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days.
6695415	4	517	Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18% of the hypertensive rats.
6695415	5	597	A single PPA/caffeine administration (same dose) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals.
6695415	6	724	These results suggest that PPA/caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage.
6695415	7	885	An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor.
6699841	0	0	Renal papillary necrosis due to naproxen.
6699841	1	42	A 31-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis, who had previously been treated with sulindac, fenoprofen calcium, high dose salicylates and gold salts, developed renal papillary necrosis (RPN) 4 months after institution of naproxen therapy.
6699841	2	281	No other factor predisposing to RPN could be discovered.
6699841	3	338	Sulindac was substituted for naproxen and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months.
6699841	4	447	We review previous reports linking RPN to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of sulindac in patients who have experienced renal toxicity from other antiinflammatory agents.
6728084	0	0	Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.
6728084	1	96	To quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days.
6728084	2	301	Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of sodium, potassium, endogenous lysozyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (GFR) were done in each treatment group.
6728084	3	638	Gentamicin administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae.
6728084	4	728	Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used.
6728084	5	798	All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium.
6728084	6	895	While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect.
6728084	7	1067	Daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin.
6728084	8	1191	Thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins.
6732043	0	0	Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration.
6732043	1	99	We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens.
6732043	2	348	When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal.
6732043	3	490	A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone.
6732043	4	607	Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea.
6732043	5	693	Our report provides direct evidence for this role.
6732043	6	744	Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep.
6732043	7	942	Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy.
6769133	0	0	Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates. 10 monkeys (macaques) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man.
6769133	1	357	Histologically, the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myeloblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug.
6769133	2	637	Our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man, and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug.
6794356	0	0	Tricuspid valve regurgitation and lithium carbonate toxicity in a newborn infant.
6794356	1	82	A newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, and a high serum lithium level is described.
6794356	2	217	This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter, and the 11th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy.
6794356	3	441	Sixty-three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement.
6794356	4	511	Lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregnancy.
6794356	5	636	It also causes neurologic depression, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmia when consumed prior to delivery.
6817363	0	0	Effects of the novel compound aniracetam (Ro 13-5057) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents.
6817363	1	100	The effect of aniracetam (Ro 13-5057, 1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine-induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition).
6817363	2	1361	These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg.
6817363	3	1482	Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped.
6817363	4	1536	The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown.
6817363	5	1631	Piracetam, another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison.
6817363	6	1700	It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of aniracetam.
6817363	7	1791	The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.
6892185	0	0	Effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats.
6892185	1	99	The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated.
6892185	2	450	Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine.
6892185	3	568	On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride.
6892185	4	718	It is apparent that calcium chloride can "dissociate" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine.
6892185	5	921	Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites.
6892185	6	1106	These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system.
6942642	0	0	Thiazide diuretics, hypokalemia and cardiac arrhythmias.
6942642	1	57	Thiazide diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs.
6942642	2	155	Hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therapy.
6942642	3	244	We treated 38 patients (22 low renin, 16 normal renin) with moderate diastolic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTC) administered on a twice daily schedule.
6942642	4	408	Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized.
6942642	5	547	The serum K during the control period was 4.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/l an on 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg HCTZ daily 3.9 +/- 0.3, 3.4 +/- 0.2, 2.9 +/- 0.2, and 2.4 +/- 0.3 mEq/l, respectively.
6942642	6	724	Corresponding figures for whole body K were 4107 +/- 208, 3722 +/- 319, 3628 +/- 257, 3551 +/- 336, and 3269 +/- 380 mEq, respectively.
6942642	7	860	In 13 patients we observed the effects of HCTZ therapy (100 mg daily) on the occurrence of PVC's during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise.
6942642	8	1016	During rest we observed 0.6 +/- 0.08 PVC beats/min +/- SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0.6 +/- 0.06 and 0.8 +/- 0.15, respectively.
6942642	9	1159	Corresponding figures during HCTZ therapy 100 mg daily were 1.4 +/- 0.1, 3.6 +/- 0.7 and 5.7 4/- 0.8, respectively.
6942642	10	1275	The occurrence of PVC's correlated significantly with the fall in serum K+ observed r = 0.72, p less than 0.001.
6942642	11	1388	In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium.
6942642	12	1486	The more profound hypokalemia, the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC's.
7007443	0	0	Circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necrosis.
7007443	1	58	The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic failure.
7007443	2	242	Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose, whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survived.
7007443	3	562	A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time, and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase, which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall.
7007443	4	809	Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs, and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition.
7053705	0	0	Hepatic veno-occlusive disease caused by 6-thioguanine.
7053705	1	56	Clinically reversible veno-occlusive disease of the liver developed in a 23-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia after 10 months of maintenance therapy with 6-thioguanine.
7053705	2	236	Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement.
7053705	3	331	Although this disease was clinically reversible, some subintimal fibrosis about the terminal hepatic veins persisted.
7053705	4	449	This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible hepatic veno-occlusive disease over time, and may be the first case of veno-occlusive related solely to 6-thioguanine.
7059267	0	0	Chlorpropamide-induced optic neuropathy.
7059267	1	41	A 65-year-old woman with adult-onset diabetes treated with chlorpropamide (Diabenese) had a toxic optic neuropathy that resolved with discontinuation of chlorpropamide therapy.
7059267	2	218	Visual loss occurs in diabetics for a variety of reasons, and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy.
7059267	3	346	The possibility of a drug-induced optic neuropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of visual loss in diabetics.
7066357	0	0	Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin aminonucleoside.
7066357	1	137	This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se, or, at least in part, to the aminonucleoside.
7066357	2	373	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syndrome.
7066357	3	603	Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-nephrotic stage (day 1-5) and nephrotic stage (day 6-11).
7066357	4	778	In pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant.
7066357	5	943	Plasma apolipoprotein A-I tended to increase (40% increase at day 5).
7066357	6	1013	At the beginning of nephrotic stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days.
7066357	7	1261	The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern.
7066357	8	1320	Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage (day 9).
7066357	9	1376	Plasma apolipoprotein A-I was found not only in HDL (1.063-1.210 g/ml) but also in the LDL density class (1.025-1.050 g/ml).
7066357	10	1501	In the pre-nephrotic stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL.
7066357	11	1660	These observations indicate that puromycin aminonucleoside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL.
7066357	12	1783	It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.
7072798	0	0	Fatal aplastic anemia following topical administration of ophthalmic chloramphenicol.
7072798	1	86	A 73-year-old woman died of aplastic anemia less than two months after undergoing cataract extraction and beginning topical therapy with chloramphenicol.
7072798	2	240	The first signs of pancytopenia began within one month of the surgery.
7072798	3	311	The pattern of the aplastic anemia was associated with an idiosyncratic response to chloramphenicol.
7072798	4	412	This was the second report of fatal aplastic anemia after topical treatment with chloramphenicol for ocular conditions, although two cases of reversible bone marrow hypoplasia have also been reported.
7072798	5	613	Any other suspected cases of ocular toxicity associated with topically applied chloramphenicol should be reported to the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201.
7102237	0	0	Midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent.
7102237	1	59	In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine (+5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer.
7102237	2	449	On the whole, the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences.
7102237	3	552	Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.
7161250	0	0	Extrapyramidal side effects and oral haloperidol: an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics.
7161250	1	116	The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with haloperidol.
7161250	2	222	The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients.
7161250	3	319	Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients.
7161250	4	412	However, these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after parkinsonism developed.
7161250	5	531	Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective.
7161250	6	669	The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to haloperidol.
7189975	0	0	Deaths from local anesthetic-induced convulsions in mice.
7189975	1	58	Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic-induced convulsions.
7189975	2	258	The CD50 and LD50, respectively, were 57.7 and 58.7 mg/kg for bupivacaine, 111.0 and 133.1 mg/kg for lidocaine, and 243.4 and 266.5 mg/kg for chloroprocaine.
7189975	3	416	When given intraperitoneally, bupivacaine thus was only about twice as toxic as lidocaine and four times as toxic as chloroprocaine.
7189975	4	549	Convulsions always preceded death, except after precipitous cardiopulmonary arrest from extreme doses.
7189975	5	652	A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing convulsions in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of bupivacaine-induced seizures, in 57% of the chloroprocaine group, and in 6% of the lidocaine group.
7189975	6	841	The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated convulsions present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated.
7197363	0	0	REM sleep deprivation changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats.
7197363	1	117	The effects of REM sleep deprivation (REMD) on apomorphine-induced aggressiveness and quipazine-induced head twitches in rats were determined.
7197363	2	260	Forty-eight hr of REMD increased apomorphine-induced aggressiveness, and reduced (immediately after completing of REMD) or increased (96 hr after completing of REMD) quipazine-induced head twitches.
7197363	3	459	Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments.
7263204	0	0	Fatal aplastic anemia due to indomethacin--lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro.
7263204	1	85	Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established.
7263204	2	257	A case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given.
7263204	3	372	Indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
7263204	4	444	A positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient.
7263204	5	620	Fortunately, this seems to be a very rare complication.
7282516	0	0	Dose-effect and structure-function relationships in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy.
7282516	1	80	The cardiomyopathy (CM) produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DXR) (Adriamycin) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of myocardial disease.
7282516	2	299	We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving DXR.
7282516	3	499	Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative DXR dose between 100 and 600 mg/m2.
7282516	4	612	Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose, exhibited a curvilinear relationship, and had a "threshold" for expression.
7282516	5	743	Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage (r = 0.57 to 0.78) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured, and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear, threshold configuration.
7282516	6	980	In DXR-CM myocardial damage is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult (DXR dose) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached, after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly.
7337133	0	0	Massive cerebral edema associated with fulminant hepatic failure in acetaminophen overdose: possible role of cranial decompression.
7337133	1	132	Cerebral edema may complicate the course of fulminant hepatic failure.
7337133	2	203	Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing.
7337133	3	260	We present a patient with fatal acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure, with signs and symptoms of cerebral edema, unresponsive to conventional medical therapy.
7337133	4	430	Cranial decompression was carried out.
7337133	5	469	A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented.
7416947	0	0	Subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long-term administration of digoxin.
7416947	1	96	Various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH).
7416947	2	296	This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH.
7416947	3	503	The patients of the study and control group (without digoxin) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients.
7416947	4	701	A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out, using parameters such as sexual desire, sexual excitement, and frequency of sexual relations.
7416947	5	887	Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior.
7416947	6	981	The findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH.
7416947	7	1083	The differences in the means were significant.
7416947	8	1130	Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire, sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.
7421734	0	0	Endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood.
7421734	1	58	A 34-year-old patient developed metastic endometrial carcinoma after Hodgkin disease in childhood.
7421734	2	157	She had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin disease, and received exogenous estrogens, a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal women.
7421734	3	366	Young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically.
7437994	0	0	Long-term lithium treatment and the kidney.
7437994	1	44	Interim report on fifty patients.
7437994	2	78	This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney.
7437994	3	187	Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year.
7437994	4	368	These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients.
7437994	5	516	No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment.
7437994	6	607	Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values.
7437994	7	720	Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients.
7437994	8	904	The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part.
7437994	9	968	Polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients.
7437994	10	1031	An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings.
7542793	0	0	Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase.
7542793	1	82	Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days.
7542793	2	410	The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated.
7542793	3	480	Cyclophilin A and FK506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract.
7542793	4	634	In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by rapamycin.
7542793	5	811	Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin.
7542793	6	934	These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.
7565311	0	0	Acute renal failure in high dose carboplatin chemotherapy.
7565311	1	59	Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patients.
7565311	2	169	We report a 4 1/2-year-old girl who was treated with high-dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
7565311	3	301	Acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function.
7565311	4	386	Possible contributing factors are discussed.
7596955	0	0	Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol.
7596955	1	131	Among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost (BPT) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (CLZ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate).
7596955	2	426	Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted.
7596955	3	516	Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14.
7596955	4	708	At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed.
7596955	5	866	Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed.
7596955	6	956	Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ.
7596955	7	1109	All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required.
7596955	8	1253	Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol).
7596955	9	1433	The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted.
7596955	10	1606	In conclusion, the combined administration of BPT/CLZ is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.
7604176	0	0	Pravastatin-associated myopathy.
7604176	1	33	Report of a case.
7604176	2	51	A case of acute inflammatory myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin, a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported.
7604176	3	219	The patient, a 69-year-old man was affected by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
7604176	4	324	He assumed pravastatin (20 mg/day) because of hypercholesterolemia.
7604176	5	392	He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation.
7604176	6	511	A previously unknown hypothyroidism, probably due to chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, was evidenced.
7604176	7	611	Muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD4+ lymphocytes.
7604176	8	746	While lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with toxic myopathy, pravastatin-associated myopathy could represent a distinct, inflammatory entity.
761833	0	0	Reversal of ammonia coma in rats by L-dopa: a peripheral effect.
761833	1	65	Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL.
761833	2	173	This coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol L-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection.
761833	3	294	The effect of L-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea.
761833	4	461	Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations.
761833	5	645	Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented.
761833	6	777	Thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L-dopa, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action.
761833	7	981	These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L-dopa.
7619765	0	0	Etoposide-related myocardial infarction.
7619765	1	41	The occurrence of a myocardial infarction is reported after chemotherapy containing etoposide, in a man with no risk factors for coronary heart disease.
7619765	2	194	Possible causal mechanisms are discussed.
7647582	0	0	Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross-react with halothane-induced antibodies.
7647582	1	108	Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane.
7647582	2	278	Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response.
7647582	3	346	An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients.
7647582	4	488	This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane.
7647582	5	624	The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models.
7647582	6	852	Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver.
7647582	7	1023	In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats.
7647582	8	1159	This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration.
7647582	9	1394	The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.
7650771	0	0	Cholinergic toxicity resulting from ocular instillation of echothiophate iodide eye drops.
7650771	1	91	A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of echothiophate iodide ophthalmic drops, presented with profound muscle weakness and was initially given the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.
7650771	2	296	Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops.
7651879	0	0	Seizure after flumazenil administration in a pediatric patient.
7651879	1	64	Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines.
7651879	2	195	Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have complicated its use in adult patients.
7651879	3	272	Overdose patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications.
7651879	4	379	Little information exists concerning adverse effects of flumazenil in children.
7651879	5	459	We report the occurrence of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a pediatric patient following the administration of flumazenil.
7707116	0	0	Phase I trial of 13-cis-retinoic acid in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation.
7707116	1	108	PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13-cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation.
7707116	2	239	Since cis-RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy.
7707116	3	382	This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of cis-RA administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
7707116	4	623	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral cis-RA administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses.
7707116	5	845	The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg/m2/d until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed.
7707116	6	941	A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted.
7707116	7	994	RESULTS: The MTD of cis-RA was 160 mg/m2/d.
7707116	8	1038	Dose-limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg/m2/d included hypercalcemia (n = 3), rash (n = 2), and anemia/thrombocytopenia/emesis/rash (n = 1).
7707116	9	1197	All toxicities resolved after cis-RA was discontinued.
7707116	10	1252	Three complete responses were observed in marrow metastases.
7707116	11	1313	Serum levels of 7.4 +/- 3.0 mumol/L (peak) and 4.0 +/- 2.8 mumol/L (trough) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy.
7707116	12	1443	The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol/L.
7707116	13	1499	CONCLUSION: The MTD of cis-RA given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg/m2/d.
7707116	14	1582	Serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dose.
7707116	15	1676	The DLT included hypercalcemia, and may be predicted by serum cis-RA levels.
7707116	16	1753	Monitoring of serum calcium and cis-RA levels is indicated in future trials.
7710775	0	0	Time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat.
7710775	1	119	Incomplete cerebral ischemia (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries.
7710775	2	233	Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before ischemia (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after ischemia.
7710775	3	395	Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides.
7710775	4	572	During ischemia, a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed.
7710775	5	666	Plasma malondialdehyde, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078).
7710775	6	917	Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher.
7710775	7	1383	The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7724492	0	0	Acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles.
7724492	1	85	Acute doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis.
7724492	2	225	In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free doxorubicin (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived.
7724492	3	393	A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX.
7724492	4	491	Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria.
7724492	5	532	Two hr post-injection, DXNP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX (p < 0.025).
7724492	6	629	In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given DX died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived.
7724492	7	798	Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX.
7724492	8	989	Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls.
7724492	9	1038	These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free DX, despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former.
7724492	10	1196	Both effects (better survival and nephrosis) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.
7752389	0	0	Prostaglandin E2-induced bladder hyperactivity in normal, conscious rats: involvement of tachykinins?
7752389	1	102	In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled prostaglandin (PG) E2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure.
7752389	2	280	The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67,580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48,968, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors.
7752389	3	517	Intra-arterially given PGE2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle.
7752389	4	720	The effect of intra-arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically.
7752389	5	1000	The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial PGE2, given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor.
7752389	6	1193	However, when given intravesically, PGE2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium.
7752389	7	1341	These tachykinins, in turn, initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK1 and NK2 receptors.
7752389	8	1437	Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.
7785794	0	0	Refractory cardiogenic shock and complete heart block after verapamil SR and metoprolol treatment.
7785794	1	99	A case report.
7785794	2	114	A seventy-eight-year-old woman presented with complete heart block and refractory hypotension two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained-release verapamil with concomitant use of metoprolol.
7785794	3	309	The patient continued to remain hypotensive with complete heart block, even with multiple uses of intravenous atropine as well as high doses of pressor agents such as dopamine and dobutamine.
7785794	4	501	However, shortly after the use of intravenous calcium chloride, the refractory hypotension and complete heart block resolved.
7791169	0	0	Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients.
7791169	1	96	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin.
7791169	2	244	METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B).
7791169	3	527	Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days).
7791169	4	753	Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain.
7791169	5	838	RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05).
7791169	6	1086	Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05).
7791169	7	1211	The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
7791169	8	1418	CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction.
7791169	9	1527	Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control.
7803371	0	0	Cognitive deterioration from long-term abuse of dextromethorphan: a case report.
7803371	1	81	Dextromethorphan (DM), the dextrorotatory isomer of 3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives.
7803371	2	249	Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability.
7803371	3	370	Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature.
7803371	4	472	The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects, ranging from nausea, restlessness, insomnia, ataxia, slurred speech and nystagmus to mood changes, perceptual alterations, inattention, disorientation and aggressive behavior (Rammer et al 1988; Katona and Watson 1986; Isbell and Fraser 1953; Devlin et al 1985; McCarthy 1971; Dodds and Revai 1967; Degkwitz 1964; Hildebrand et al 1989).
7803371	5	871	There have also been two reported fatalities from DM overdoses (Fleming 1986).
7803371	6	950	However, there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse.
7803371	7	1021	This report describes a case of cognitive deterioration resulting from prolonged use of DM.
783197	0	0	Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.
783197	1	108	A hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic study in patients without heart failure.
783197	2	190	The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man.
783197	3	394	We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure.
783197	4	610	Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted.
783197	5	815	Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients.
783197	6	996	Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed.
783197	7	1247	The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility.
783197	8	1438	No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients.
783197	9	1514	No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients.
783197	10	1733	We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal.
783197	11	1955	Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption.
783197	12	2173	Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.
7843916	0	0	Dexamethasone-induced ocular hypertension in perfusion-cultured human eyes.
7843916	1	76	PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility.
7843916	2	282	The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes.
7843916	3	443	METHODS: The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow, variable pressure perfusion culture system.
7843916	4	594	Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M dexamethasone for 12 days.
7843916	5	692	Intraocular pressure was monitored daily.
7843916	6	734	After incubation, the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and scanning laser confocal microscopy.
7843916	7	904	RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of dexamethasone exposure.
7843916	8	1121	The contralateral control eyes, which did not receive dexamethasone, maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period.
7843916	9	1255	The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal.
7843916	10	1330	In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm.
7843916	11	1692	The dexamethasone-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle dexamethasone-induced morphologic changes were evident.
7843916	12	1878	CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes.
7843916	13	2058	Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma.
7843916	14	2214	This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma.
7880714	0	0	Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block.
7880714	1	73	We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block (IBPB).
7880714	2	219	Bupivacaine 0.75% with adrenaline was given followed by a 24-hr continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine.
7880714	3	325	Three audiometric threshold measurements (0.25-18 kHz) were made: the first before IBPB, the second 2-6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation.
7880714	4	493	In four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation, in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day.
7880714	5	665	The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients; in one only low frequencies (0.25-0.5 kHz) were involved.
7880714	6	797	The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bupivacaine.
7880714	7	911	This patient had hearing threshold changes (15-20 dB) at 6-10 kHz on the opposite side also.
7880714	8	1004	IBPB may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear, possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation.
7905523	0	0	The safety and efficacy of combination N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) and zidovudine in patients with HIV-1 infection and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3.
7905523	1	150	We conducted a double-blind, randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) (an alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone.
7905523	2	380	Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC-48334 (1000 mg every 8 h) and zidovudine (100 mg every 8 h) or zidovudine and placebo.
7905523	3	576	Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, zidovudine and placebo.
7905523	4	652	Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15).
7905523	5	783	The mean SC-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
7905523	6	945	The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively (p > 0.36).
7905523	7	1092	For patients with prior zidovudine therapy, the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and zidovudine groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively.
7905523	8	1317	The number of patients with suppression of HIV p24 antigenemia in the combination and zidovudine groups was six (40%) and two (11%) at week 4 (p = 0.10) and five (45%) and two (14%) at week 24 (p = 0.08), respectively.
7905523	9	1536	Diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, and weight loss were common for combination recipients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7910951	0	0	Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids.
7910951	1	94	The long-term use of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (ND-NMBA) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness, although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear.
7910951	2	321	We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND-NMBAs.
7910951	3	473	Two patients also received intravenous corticosteroids.
7910951	4	529	Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients, and all had acidosis.
7910951	5	628	Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials, normal sensory studies, and fibrillations.
7910951	6	755	Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients.
7910951	7	831	The serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng/mL.
7910951	8	940	A muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick, myosin filaments.
7910951	9	1012	The weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction (most likely due to ND-NMBA) and muscle (most likely due to corticosteroids).
7910951	10	1176	Hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors.
8012887	0	0	Failure of ancrod in the treatment of heparin-induced arterial thrombosis.
8012887	1	75	The morbidity and mortality associated with heparin-induced thrombosis remain high despite numerous empirical therapies.
8012887	2	196	Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of thrombosis in patients with heparin induced platelet aggregation who require brief reexposure to heparin, but its success in patients who have developed the thrombosis syndrome is not well defined.
8012887	3	467	The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with heparin-induced thrombosis.
803783	0	0	Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion.
803783	1	91	Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described.
803783	2	214	The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases.
803783	3	289	Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches.
803783	4	623	The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions.
803783	5	759	The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases.
803783	6	911	The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours.
803783	7	974	If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.
804391	0	0	Light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tuberculosis.
804391	1	103	Light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifampin.
804391	2	193	Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different.
804391	3	352	Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight tuberculosis patients tested, but there occurred a hyper-responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen (PHA-P). as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patients.
804391	4	615	This last finding may be related to time of testing and/or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte.
8045270	0	0	KF17837: a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity.
8045270	1	91	KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist.
8045270	2	155	Oral administration of KF17837 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner.
8045270	3	407	KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.).
8045270	4	513	These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively.
8045270	5	628	Moreover, KF17837 (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (6.25 mg/kg i.p.).
8045270	6	819	These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists.
8045270	7	1030	Furthermore, KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism.
8106150	0	0	Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L-dopa-induced dyskinesias in MPTP-treated monkeys.
8106150	1	87	A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP.
8106150	2	158	They were then treated chronically with L-DOPA/benserazide 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months.
8106150	3	264	This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested dyskinesia.
8106150	4	358	A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified.
8106150	5	533	Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology.
8106150	6	733	However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements.
8106150	7	815	Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia.
8106150	8	898	Atropine converted the dystonic movements into chorea.
8111719	0	0	Hallucinations and ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity.
8111719	1	53	BACKGROUND: Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide.
8111719	2	178	Most cases of ifosfamide-induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes.
8111719	3	279	METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide-induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium.
8111719	4	401	All patients were receiving high-dose ifosfamide as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure.
8111719	5	501	RESULTS: Hallucinations occurred only when the patient's eyes were closed and, in all but one case, were reported as disturbing or frightening.
8111719	6	645	Underreporting of these hallucinations by patients is likely.
8111719	7	707	CONCLUSIONS: Hallucinations may be the sole or first manifestation of neurotoxicity.
8111719	8	792	The incidence may be dose and infusion-time related.
8111719	9	845	The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide-induced hallucinations, which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity. "Eyes-closed" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation.
8111719	10	1073	Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence.
8111719	11	1173	Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear.
8111719	12	1240	If agitation becomes marked, high-potency neuroleptics (i.e., haloperidol) may be effective.
8251368	0	0	Photodistributed nifedipine-induced facial telangiectasia.
8251368	1	59	Five months after starting nifedipine (Adalat), two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia, which became more noticeable with time.
8251368	2	210	Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or flushing.
8251368	3	270	Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug.
8251368	4	358	One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later, with recurrence of telangiectasia.
8251368	5	458	The photodistribution of the telangiectasia suggests a significant drug/light interaction.
8267029	0	0	Penicillamine-induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
8267029	1	101	A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) after 5 months of D-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment.
8267029	2	261	Light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with crescent formation in 60% of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole.
8267029	3	433	Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG, IgA and C3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium.
8267029	4	543	The patient was treated with steroid pulse, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet agents.
8267029	5	645	A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks.
8267029	6	712	This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients.
8267029	7	909	The prompt discontinuation of D-penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case.
8268147	0	0	A case of polymyositis in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with D-penicillamine.
8268147	1	97	Although D-penicillamine has been used for many rheumatologic diseases, toxicity limits its usefulness in many patients.
8268147	2	218	Polymyositis/dermatomyositis can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of D-penicillamine treatment, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear.
8268147	3	372	We report a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis, who developed polymyositis while receiving D-penicillamine therapy.
8268147	4	492	We described the special clinical course of the patient.
8268147	5	549	Patients receiving D-penicillamine therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like polymyositis/dermatomyositis.
8278214	0	0	Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine.
8278214	1	101	Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia.
8278214	2	233	All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen.
8278214	3	318	Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus.
8278214	4	431	In 3 patients a pre-existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously.
8278214	5	565	Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome.
8278214	6	846	The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.
8305357	0	0	Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma: a phase II study.
8305357	1	71	We report a non-randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma.
8305357	2	245	Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial.
8305357	3	325	Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured.
8305357	4	415	Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed.
8305357	5	482	Ten subjects were evaluated.
8305357	6	511	A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed.
8305357	7	587	Stabilization of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four.
8305357	8	706	The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity.
8305357	9	781	The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l).
8305357	10	927	There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity.
8305357	11	968	In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.
8384253	0	0	Long-term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system.
8384253	1	67	Forty patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system.
8384253	2	306	The patients were interviewed with emphasis on neuropathic symptoms.
8384253	3	375	Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed, four to 77 months (median 34 months) after vincristine treatment.
8384253	4	584	Twenty-seven patients reported neuropathic symptoms.
8384253	5	637	In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination.
8384253	6	720	In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated.
8384253	7	779	In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past.
8384253	8	843	Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy.
8384253	9	910	There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination.
8384253	10	1011	Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients.
8384253	11	1064	Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term.
8384253	12	1131	It is concluded that with the above mentioned vincristine dose schedule signs and symptoms of vincristine neuropathy are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good.
839274	0	0	Hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver in young women on oral contraceptives: case reports.
839274	1	113	Two cases of hepatic adenoma and one of focal nodular hyperplasia presumably associated with the use of oral contraceptives, are reported.
839274	2	252	Special reference is made to their clinical presentation, which may be totally asymptomatic.
839274	3	345	Liver-function tests are of little diagnostic value, but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angiography.
839274	4	489	Histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver are discussed.
8410199	0	0	Loss of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA-containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine-induced seizures.
8410199	1	121	In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure-induced damage in a model of chronic seizures.
8410199	2	346	Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine-induced seizures.
8410199	3	542	In situ hybridization histochemistry, using a digoxigenin-labeled GAD cRNA probe, demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine-treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals.
8410199	4	818	Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl violet staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels.
8410199	5	1135	The loss of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer.
8410199	6	1313	Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals.
8410199	7	1565	No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer, which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer.
8410199	8	1734	The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure-induced damage.
8410199	9	1901	Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of GABA neurons.
8424298	0	0	Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function.
8424298	1	103	The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients.
8424298	2	229	Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group).
8424298	3	378	Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group.
8424298	4	444	The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group.
8424298	5	686	The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall.
8424298	6	1016	The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively.
8424298	7	1084	There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value.
8424298	8	1238	The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.
8441146	0	0	Apparent cure of rheumatoid arthritis by bone marrow transplantation.
8441146	1	70	We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 2 patients.
8441146	2	234	BMT was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D-penicillamine in the other.
8441146	3	350	In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants (representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy, respectively), the RA in each case has been completely quiescent.
8441146	4	537	Although short term remission of severe RA following BMT has been reported, these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available.
8441146	5	688	This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis.
8473723	0	0	Seizures induced by combined levomepromazine-fluvoxamine treatment.
8473723	1	68	We report a case of combined levomepromazine-fluvoxamine treatment-induced seizures.
8473723	2	153	It seems that combined treatment of fluvoxamine with phenothiazines may possess proconvulsive activity.
8475949	0	0	Case report: pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia revisited.
8475949	1	76	Pentamidine isethionate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including torsade de pointes.
8475949	2	185	This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date.
8475949	3	277	Pentamidine-induced torsade de pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade.
8475949	4	412	Torsade de pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine.
8475949	5	499	In these patients, no other acute side effects of pentamidine were observed.
8475949	6	576	Torsade de pointes can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine.
8475949	7	682	When QTc interval prolongation is observed, early magnesium supplementation is advocated.
8480959	0	0	Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.
8480959	1	90	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia.
8480959	2	196	DESIGN: The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks.
8480959	3	486	SETTING: Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States.
8480959	4	584	PATIENTS: Women (n = 3390) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers.
8480959	5	653	MEASUREMENTS: Plasma total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study.
8480959	6	879	RESULTS: Among women, lovastatin (20 to 80 mg/d) produced sustained (12- to 48-week), dose-related changes (P < 0.001): decreases in LDL cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglycerides (9% to 18%), and increases in HDL cholesterol (6.7% to 8.6%).
8480959	7	1121	Depending on the dose, from 82% to 95% of lovastatin-treated women achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of LDL cholesterol levels less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL), and 40% to 87% achieved the goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL).
8480959	8	1367	Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0.1% of women and were dose dependent above the 20-mg dose.
8480959	9	1525	Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg).
8480959	10	1730	Estrogen-replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of lovastatin.
8480959	11	1842	CONCLUSION: Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in women.
8492347	0	0	Tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide--importance of magnesium supplementation.
8492347	1	100	Diuretics may induce hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia.
8492347	2	167	While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness, severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone (1,2).
8492347	3	365	Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described, mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or edematous.
8492347	4	486	Symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients (3-7) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed (8), but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients.
8494478	0	0	Ciprofloxacin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer.
8494478	1	62	Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon.
8494478	2	120	Five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed.
8494478	3	305	Other than elevation of serum creatinine levels, characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present.
8494478	4	454	Allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological-process.
8494478	5	541	Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy, although this is not always feasible.
8494478	6	638	An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced acute renal failure.
8514073	0	0	Venous complications of midazolam versus diazepam.
8514073	1	51	Although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures, this variable has not been well documented.
8514073	2	235	We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
8514073	3	436	Overall, venous complications were more frequent with diazepam (22 of 62 patients) than with midazolam (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001).
8514073	4	571	A palpable venous cord was present in 23% (14 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group, compared with 2% (1 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.002).
8514073	5	731	Pain at the injection site occurred in 35% (22 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7% (4 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.001).
8514073	6	891	Swelling and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups.
8514073	7	990	Smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, intravenous catheter site, dwell time of the needle, alcohol use, and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications.
8546130	0	0	Clarithromycin-associated visual hallucinations in a patient with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
8546130	1	134	Visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se.
8546130	2	232	Unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin.
8546130	3	362	We describe such a case in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
8546130	4	499	The combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying aluminum intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect.
8546130	5	735	It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of chronic renal failure, the possibility of drug interactions, and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the ESRD patient.
85485	0	0	Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha-benzene hexachloride.
85485	1	106	Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically.
85485	2	290	Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes.
85485	3	514	At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages.
85485	4	616	A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes.
85485	5	734	Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared.
85485	6	859	These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed.
85485	7	995	No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate unlike in the case of rats.
8586822	0	0	Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt-sensitivity in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats.
8586822	1	130	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation.
8586822	2	365	METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal sodium chloride diet or were fed a high sodium chloride diet.
8586822	3	558	After 2 weeks, the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later, an infusion of clonidine.
8586822	4	664	RESULTS: Lifetime captopril treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups.
8586822	5	763	Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride-induced increase in MAP in both groups.
8586822	6	943	Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) sodium chloride diet.
8586822	7	1164	CONCLUSIONS: In both lifetime captopril-treated and control SHR, the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high sodium chloride diet.
8599504	0	0	Angioedema associated with droperidol administration.
8599504	1	54	Angioedema, also known as angioneurotic edema or Quincke's disease, is a well-demarcated, localized edema involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause upper-airway obstruction.
8599504	2	236	We report the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old man with no known drug allergies in whom angioedema with significant tongue swelling and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of droperidol.
8600333	0	0	Late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor.
8600333	1	64	Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen's T5 or T10 protocol, both including doxorubicin.
8600333	2	228	Thirty-one patients, age 10-45 years (median age 17.8 years) were evaluated 2.3-14.1 years (median 8.9 years) following completion of treatment.
8600333	3	373	Cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360).
8600333	4	443	The evaluation consisted of a history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), signal averaged ECG, 24-hour ambulatory ECG, echocardiography and radionuclide angiography.
8600333	5	621	Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed cardiac toxicity, defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction.
8600333	6	878	The incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow-up (P< or = .05).
8600333	7	967	No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability.
8600333	8	1098	When adjusted to body surface area, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW index) was decreased in all patients.
8600333	9	1224	The incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose.
8600333	10	1347	Life-long cardiac follow-up in these patients is warranted.
8600333	11	1407	The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity.
8607407	0	0	Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension.
8607407	1	92	Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated.
8607407	2	205	Thus, caffeine (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions.
8607407	3	348	Borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg.
8607407	4	499	Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg.
8607407	5	608	Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits.
8607407	6	762	Caffeine-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004).
8607407	7	1043	These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols.
8607407	8	1118	The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%.
8607407	9	1231	Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion.
8607407	10	1422	Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives.
8607407	11	1656	We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.
8617710	0	0	Absence of effect of sertraline on time-based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol.
8617710	1	102	This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects.
8617710	2	300	METHOD: All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25.
8617710	3	386	From Days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg/day from Days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period.
8617710	4	656	Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on Days 1, 2, and 25.
8617710	5	772	RESULTS: Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing.
8617710	6	928	When single-dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect.
8617710	7	1118	There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group.
8617710	8	1272	Three subjects (2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects.
8617710	9	1371	Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment.
8617710	10	1442	The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar.
8617710	11	1510	CONCLUSION: Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration.
8638876	0	0	Coexistence of cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis associated with exogenous sex hormones.
8638876	1	116	A case report.
8638876	2	131	A forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed headache, nausea and vomiting, left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol.
8638876	3	303	Diabetes mellitus (DM) was found during admission.
8638876	4	354	Computed tomography showed a hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS).
8638876	5	489	Left carotid angiography found occlusion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA).
8638876	6	573	Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus, suggestive of venous sinus thrombosis.
8638876	7	689	Coexistence of the cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion has been described infrequently.
8638876	8	788	In this case, the authors postulate that the use of estradiol and progesterone and the underlying DM increased vascular thrombogenicity, which provided a common denominator for thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus.
8643966	0	0	Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel: a phase II trial.
8643966	1	98	Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma.
8643966	2	284	Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%.
8643966	3	464	Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia.
8643966	4	555	We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.
8643966	5	701	The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2.
8643966	6	839	Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC.
8643966	7	881	Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication.
8643966	8	983	Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%).
8643966	9	1116	Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2.
8643966	10	1236	Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy.
8643966	11	1344	Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4.
8643966	12	1463	Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4.
8643966	13	1586	Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity.
8643966	14	1813	Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.
8643973	0	0	Paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
8643973	1	93	In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2.
8643973	2	471	The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula.
8643973	3	625	In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg/m2.
8643973	4	765	To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study.
8643973	5	930	The dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia).
8643973	6	1051	Neurotoxicity was largely moderate.
8643973	7	1087	So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients.
8643973	8	1245	No patient had disease progression.
8643973	9	1281	We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting.
8643973	10	1519	The recommended dose for phase III studies is paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6.
8665051	0	0	Effects of acute steroid administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats.
8665051	1	87	Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids.
8665051	2	211	The mechanism of this myopathy is poorly understood.
8665051	3	264	Therefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), methylprednisolone (M), or triamcinolone (T) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid-treated groups (-50 and -79% in M and T, respectively).
8665051	4	585	This was associated with a similar loss in body weight.
8665051	5	641	In the 45 remaining animals, diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied.
8665051	6	756	Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after steroid treatment.
8665051	7	852	Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the M group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS).
8665051	8	1029	Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with M, whereas tetanic tensions were similar.
8665051	9	1171	Steroid treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force-frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment (p < 0.05).
8665051	10	1312	ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis.
8665051	11	1574	Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that muscle atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals.
8665051	12	1744	We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy, resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb atrophy was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.
8677458	0	0	Continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna to prevent ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.
8677458	1	100	Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent.
8677458	2	242	Mesna is generally administered by the intravenous route, although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased.
8677458	3	366	The continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access.
8677458	4	473	In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide-induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug.
8677458	5	737	Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mesna administration suggests it is a safe, practical, and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting.
8686832	0	0	Leg and back pain after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
8686832	1	79	Fifty-four patients, aged 27-90 years, who were given lignocaine 5% in 6.8% glucose solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied.
8686832	2	209	Thirteen of these patients experienced pain in the legs and/or back after recovery from anaesthesia.
8686832	3	310	The patients affected were younger (p < 0.05) and the site of the dural puncture was higher (p < 0.01) than those individuals without pain.
8686832	4	450	Five of the 13 patients (38%) with pain and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake, which might be a contributing factor.
8686832	5	611	Leg and/or back pain is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine.
871943	0	0	The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea.
871943	1	59	Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase.
871943	2	232	Adequate spontaneous respiration was re-established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection.
871943	3	341	In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase.
871943	4	449	In three patients none of the usual variants were found.
871943	5	506	It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succinylcholine.
871943	6	629	The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist.
873132	0	0	Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol-induced cholestasis in rats.
873132	1	125	Deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats.
873132	2	251	Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment.
873132	3	414	During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats.
873132	4	599	Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid.
873132	5	791	Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01).
873132	6	992	These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species.
873132	7	1129	Furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic.
873132	8	1236	When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.
8742498	0	0	Influence of diet free of NAD-precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice.
8742498	1	82	Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide, a selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from acetaminophen (AAP)-hepatitis, suggesting that the AAP-induced liver injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation.
8742498	2	386	The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals.
8742498	3	621	Liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT).
8742498	4	760	While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide (NAA), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD.
8742498	5	1043	In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP, and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the liver damage was inhibited by 50% by ethanol.
8742498	6	1277	A further 64% reduction of hepatitis was observed, when NAA was given to ethanol/AAP-mice.
8742498	7	1368	Our results provide evidence that the AAP-induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate NAD.
8742498	8	1578	We see the main application of NAA as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic.
8766220	0	0	Nightmares and hallucinations after long-term intake of tramadol combined with antidepressants.
8766220	1	96	Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain.
8766220	2	250	This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic pain.
8766220	3	379	Fifty-six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho-active drugs and tramadol.
8766220	4	541	The case report questions the long term use of pain killers combined with psycho-active drugs in chronic non malignant pain, especially if pain is under control.
8800187	0	0	Effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats.
8800187	1	88	BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose.
8800187	2	186	Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues.
8800187	3	277	This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.
8800187	4	394	METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose.
8800187	5	531	CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine.
8800187	6	558	Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension, QRS prolongation, and bradycardia.
8800187	7	688	Fifteen min later, animals received CaCl2, NaHCO3, or saline.
8800187	8	750	In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline.
8800187	9	877	RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation.
8800187	10	952	CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure.
8800187	11	1012	The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups.
8800187	12	1142	CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats.
8800187	13	1271	CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity.
8800187	14	1362	These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.
8841157	0	0	Valsartan, a new angiotensin II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension: a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine.
8841157	1	155	OBJECTIVE: To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new angiotensin II antagonist, valsartan, with a reference therapy, amlodipine.
8841157	2	292	METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks.
8841157	3	503	After 8 weeks of therapy, in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled, 5 mg amlodipine was added to the initial therapy.
8841157	4	635	Patients were assessed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
8841157	5	681	The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks.
8841157	6	789	Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates.
8841157	7	881	RESULTS: Both valsartan and amlodipine were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
8841157	8	985	Similar decreases were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed.
8841157	9	1125	For the primary variable the difference was 0.5 mm Hg in favor of valsartan (p = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.7 to 1.7).
8841157	10	1251	Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66.7% for valsartan and 60.2% for amlodipine (p = 0.39).
8841157	11	1340	Both treatments were well tolerated.
8841157	12	1377	The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan; 3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine; 0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine; 14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine).
8841157	13	1629	CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.
8841157	14	1761	The results also show valsartan to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.
8854309	0	0	A measure of pupillary oscillation as a marker of cocaine-induced paranoia.
8854309	1	76	Cocaine-induced paranoia (CIP) remains an important drug-induced model of idiopathic paranoia for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged.
8854309	2	225	Measures of pupillary oscillation were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent crack cocaine abusers endorsing past CIP (n = 32) from another group of crack addicts who denied past CIP (n = 29).
8888541	0	0	Serotonin syndrome from venlafaxine-tranylcypromine interaction.
8888541	1	65	Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle rigidity, salivation, confusion, agitation and hyperthermia.
8888541	2	250	The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
8888541	3	397	Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.
8888541	4	499	We report a venlafaxine-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression.
8888541	5	646	He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of venlafaxine.
8888541	6	734	Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities, tremors and rigidity.
8888541	7	829	He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering, myoclonic jerks, rigidity, salivation and diaphoresis.
8888541	8	985	His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light.
8888541	9	1040	Vital signs were: blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg, heart rate 127/min, respiratory rate 28/min, and temperature 97 F.
8888541	10	1154	After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle rigidity and clenched jaws.
8888541	11	1246	He was intubated for airway protection and because of hypoventilation, and was paralyzed to control muscle rigidity.
8888541	12	1363	His subsequent course was remarkable for non-immune thrombocytopenia which resolved.
8888541	13	1448	The patient's maximal temperature was 101.2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units/L with no other evidence of rhabdomyolysis.
8888541	14	1571	His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward.
8888541	15	1645	This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular paralysis.
8911359	0	0	Cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer--a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases.
8911359	1	95	PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial cancer.
8911359	2	216	MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder cancer were reviewed.
8911359	3	363	RESULTS: All tumors were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell carcinoma.
8911359	4	430	Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease.
8911359	5	531	Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months.
8911359	6	614	The remaining patient with extensive cancer underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later.
8911359	7	727	CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide associated bladder tumor is an aggressive disease.
8911359	8	808	However, long-term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for bladder tumors with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease, even when noninvasive.
8958188	0	0	A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol (DDATHF) given with oral folic acid.
8958188	1	102	Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis.
8958188	2	249	Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate.
8958188	3	413	However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities.
8958188	4	546	Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose.
8958188	5	741	This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation.
8958188	6	951	Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities.
8958188	7	1009	There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation.
8958188	8	1110	Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance.
8958188	9	1333	The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor.
8958188	10	1479	This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy.
8988571	0	0	Fatal excited delirium following cocaine use: epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of cocaine toxicity.
8988571	1	126	We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine-induced excited delirium (EDDs) in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990.
8988571	2	252	From a registry of all cocaine-related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium.
8988571	3	435	Compared with controls, EDDs were more frequently black, male, and younger.
8988571	4	511	They were less likely to have a low body mass index, and more likely to have died in police custody, to have received medical treatment immediately before death, to have survived for a longer period, to have developed hyperthermia, and to have died in summer months.
8988571	5	778	EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls.
8988571	6	891	The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic cocaine use disrupts dopaminergic function and, when coupled with recent cocaine use, may precipitate agitation, delirium, aberrant thermoregulation, rhabdomyolysis, and sudden death.
9022662	0	0	Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis: case report and review of the literature.
9022662	1	82	BACKGROUND: Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder.
9022662	2	238	Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement disorders.
9022662	3	338	The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis.
9022662	4	453	CASE REPORT: Two, 3-year-old male, identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of pemoline originally containing 59 tablets.
9022662	5	639	The children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success.
9022662	6	774	This was their first day of pemoline therapy.
9022662	7	820	The choreoathetoid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion.
9022662	8	886	The children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement disorders.
9022662	9	998	The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements.
9022662	10	1154	Despite treatment, the children continued to have choreoathetosis for approximately 24 hours.
9022662	11	1248	Forty-eight hours after admission, the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home.
9022662	12	1355	CONCLUSION: Pemoline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature.
9022662	13	1466	The possibility of choreoathetoid movements should be considered in patients presenting after pemoline overdose.
9041081	0	0	Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve.
9041081	1	125	PURPOSE: To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on the retina and optic nerve.
9041081	2	253	SETTING: Eye Clinic, S. Salvatore Hospital, L'Aquila University, Italy.
9041081	3	325	METHODS: Standard pattern electroretinograms (P-ERGs) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials (P-VEPs) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5.00 and 15.00 diopters (D) (mean 8.00 D).
9041081	4	568	Testing was done preoperatively and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively.
9041081	5	645	The contralateral eyes served as controls.
9041081	6	688	During the follow-up, 3 patients (12%) developed steroid-induced elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that resolved after corticosteroid therapy was discontinued.
9041081	7	850	RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively.
9041081	8	1004	CONCLUSION: Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment.
9041081	9	1087	The transient steroid-induced IOP rise did not seem to cause functional impairment.
9061311	0	0	Neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in patients with acute liver failure.
9061311	1	93	Defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure (ALF).
9061311	2	256	In the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers.
9061311	3	399	Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum.
9061311	4	528	Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01).
9061311	5	713	This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (P < 0.05).
9061311	6	796	Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils.
9061311	7	997	Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.0005).
9061311	8	1112	These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.
9067481	0	0	Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and galactosamine.
9067481	1	158	In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).
9067481	2	376	To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity.
9067481	3	705	The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical.
9067481	4	850	A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration.
9067481	5	1139	Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult.
9067481	6	1250	These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death.
9067481	7	1374	The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity).
9067481	8	1590	However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation.
9067481	9	1719	Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.
9098464	0	0	A murine model of adenomyosis: the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats.
9098464	1	192	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis.
9098464	2	375	DESIGN: Fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia.
9098464	3	502	The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls.
9098464	4	648	Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days.
9098464	5	772	SETTING: Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Zeynep Kamil Women and Children's Hospital.
9098464	6	904	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum prolactin levels, uterine histopathology.
9098464	7	975	RESULTS: The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups.
9098464	8	1156	Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis, all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine.
9098464	9	1267	CONCLUSION: It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma.
9098464	10	1465	This invasion eventually progresses to adenomyosis.
9105126	0	0	Postinfarction ventricular septal defect associated with long-term steroid therapy.
9105126	1	84	Two cases of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture in patients on long-term steroid therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described.
9105126	2	246	A possible association between steroid therapy and subsequent postinfarction septal rupture is discussed.
9121607	0	0	Neuroactive steroids protect against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus in mice.
9121607	1	122	Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice.
9121607	2	438	Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and status epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.).
9121607	3	703	The corresponding epimers with the 3-hydroxy group in the beta-position were also effective but less potent (ED50 values, 33.8-63.5, i.p.).
9121607	4	843	Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity.
9121607	5	1243	Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures.
9121607	6	1474	However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and status epilepticus was obtained.
9121607	7	1663	The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality.
9121607	8	1823	We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and status epilepticus in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of status epilepticus in humans.
9154656	0	0	Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome.
9154656	1	96	Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome (NS).
9154656	2	228	In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of angiotensinogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, nephrotic, and pair-fed (PF) rats.
9154656	3	497	NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN).
9154656	4	571	Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection, when NS was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change.
9154656	5	758	Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after PAN injection.
9154656	6	928	These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN.
9165568	0	0	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone.
9165568	1	49	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia.
9165568	2	177	Risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade.
9165568	3	314	The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages.
9165568	4	429	With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered.
9165568	5	567	A 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone.
9165568	6	664	The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine.
9165568	7	776	It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
9201797	0	0	The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats.
9201797	1	125	It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment.
9201797	2	297	Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia.
9201797	3	588	Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist.
9201797	4	812	Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy.
9201797	5	906	The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden.
9201797	6	1026	Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats.
9201797	7	1158	Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats.
9201797	8	1291	In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats.
9201797	9	1489	Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats.
9201797	10	1565	These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.
9205462	0	0	Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use.
9205462	1	76	BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tamoxifen.
9205462	2	174	Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors.
9205462	3	268	CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma.
9205462	4	394	Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use.
9205462	5	504	After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic granulosa cell tumor of the ovary.
9205462	6	643	CONCLUSION: Patients with tamoxifen-induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism.
9209318	0	0	Lifetime treatment of mice with azidothymidine (AZT) produces myelodysplasia.
9209318	1	78	AZT has induced a macrocytic anemia in AIDS patients on long term AZT therapy.
9209318	2	157	It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of AZT into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the phosphate hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation.
9209318	3	426	CBA/Ca male mice started on AZT 0.75 mg/ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0.5 mg/ml H2O for a group, another group removed from AZT to see recovery, and third group remained on 0.75 mg.
9209318	4	654	At 687 days mice that had been on 0.75 mg had average platelet counts of 2.5 x 10(6).
9209318	5	740	Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
9209318	6	871	A variety of histological patterns was observed.
9209318	7	920	There were two cases of hypocellular myelodysplasia, two cases of hypersegmented myelodysplastic granulocytosis, two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei, one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a hyperplastic marrow, dysmyelopoiesis and a hypocellular marrow and two cases of myelodysplasia with dyserythropoiesis, hemosiderosis and a hypocellular marrow.
9209318	8	1331	Above mentioned AZT incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells, which is known to be seen commonly in the myelodysplastic syndrome.
921394	0	0	Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine.
921394	1	99	Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery.
921394	2	231	Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action.
921394	3	373	This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase.
921394	4	451	Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery.
921394	5	737	This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.
9214597	0	0	Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis.
9214597	1	186	Estrogens, which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers, can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats.
9214597	2	340	The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown.
9214597	3	448	To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.
9214597	4	823	The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry.
9214597	5	918	The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure.
9214597	6	1079	The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats.
9214597	7	1234	VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells.
9214597	8	1456	After 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels.
9214597	9	1613	The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear.
9214597	10	1672	Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure.
9214597	11	1866	These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.
9226773	0	0	Persistent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus following lithium therapy.
9226773	1	69	We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic dehydration following a head injury.
9226773	2	174	Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and lithium therapy had been discontinued.
9226773	3	316	He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion, with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
9226773	4	539	Lithium induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped.
9226773	5	721	We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
9228650	0	0	Effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine-induced amnesia.
9228650	1	70	The effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine-induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E-2020.
9228650	2	267	NIK-247, tacrine and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively).
9228650	3	442	In addition, NIK-247 and tacrine, but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum.
9228650	4	556	All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity.
9228650	5	616	Moreover, the inhibitory effect of NIK-247 on AChE was reversible.
9228650	6	683	All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.
9228650	7	837	The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats.
9228650	8	940	These findings suggest that NIK-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine-induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement.
9228650	9	1088	The findings suggest that NIK-247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
9270571	0	0	Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, A-86929: an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa-primed monkeys.
9270571	1	138	The clinical utility of dopamine (DA) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear.
9270571	2	260	The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ([1R, 3S] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for SKF-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for A-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance).
9270571	3	699	We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action.
9270571	4	1207	Levodopa and the DA D2-like receptor agonist, LY-171555 ([4aR-trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o-dihydro-5n-propyl-2H-pyrazo lo-3-4-quinoline hydrochloride) were also used for comparison.
9270571	5	1387	Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa.
9270571	6	1653	Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist.
9270571	7	1907	Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A-86929 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention.
9305828	0	0	Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
9305828	1	84	Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
9305828	2	235	This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block seizure-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices.
9305828	3	411	The pilocarpine (PILO) model of epilepsy is characterized by an acute period of status epilepticus followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures and related brain damage.
9305828	4	579	We report peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model.
9305828	5	678	PILO-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells.
9305828	6	870	NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala and sensorimotor areas.
9305828	7	980	In addition, PILO injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls.
9305828	8	1110	The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the PILO model of TLE.
9305828	9	1303	However, the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined.
9321531	0	0	Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson's disease.
9321531	1	67	BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up.
9321531	2	290	METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ("off" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ("on" period).
9321531	3	483	All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years.
9321531	4	633	RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent).
9321531	5	1197	The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years.
9321531	6	1377	The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months.
9321531	7	1530	Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery.
9321531	8	1696	The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication.
9321531	9	1820	CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability.
9321531	10	1958	Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year.
9321531	11	2122	The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.
9326871	0	0	Clarithromycin-induced ventricular tachycardia.
9326871	1	48	Clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice-daily dosing.
9326871	2	136	It differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6.
9326871	3	226	Although the side-effect profile of erythromycin is established, including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer macrolides is still being recorded.
9326871	4	467	Cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides.
9326871	5	622	We report a case of ventricular dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin.
9326871	6	728	The dysrhythmias resolved after discontinuation of the drug.
9431903	0	0	Effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the sphincter of Oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine-morphine administration.
9431903	1	108	OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine-morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.
9431903	2	300	METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine-morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
9431903	3	513	The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion (Nitrolingual 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min).
9431903	4	627	RESULTS: Prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
9431903	5	1125	Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate.
9431903	6	1528	CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans.
9431903	7	1684	Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine, it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.
950631	0	0	Immunopathology of penicillamine-induced glomerular disease.
950631	1	61	Four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with D-penicillamine.
950631	2	188	Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase, or no departure from normal.
950631	3	341	Electron microscopy, however, revealed subepithelial electron-dense deposits, fusion of epithelial cell foot processes, and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity.
950631	4	507	Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C3.
950631	5	598	The findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis, differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early-acting complement components C1q and C4.
950631	6	790	It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway.
9514561	0	0	Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin: a PET study.
9514561	1	62	Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval.
9514561	2	276	It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'.
9514561	3	418	To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients.
9514561	4	586	A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve.
9514561	5	752	Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum.
9514561	6	913	Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state.
9514561	7	1087	The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.
9523850	0	0	Value of methylprednisolone in prevention of the arthralgia-myalgia syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of iron dextran: a double blind randomized trial.
9523850	1	167	The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion (TDI) of iron dextran has been well documented.
9523850	2	262	In 40% of treated patients, an arthralgia-myalgia syndrome develops.
9523850	3	331	The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous (i.v.) administration of methylprednisolone (MP) prevents this complication.
9523850	4	511	Sixty-five patients, 34 women and 31 men, ages 36 to 80 years, received either normal saline before and after TDI (group 1), 125 mg i.v. MP before and saline after TDI (group 2), or 125 mg i.v. MP before and after TDI (group 3).
9523850	5	740	Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity.
9523850	6	838	Fifty-eight percent of group 1 patients, 33% of group 2, and 26% of group 3 had reactions to TDI.
9523850	7	936	The severity of reactions (minimal, mild, and moderate, respectively) was as follows: group 1--6, 6, and 2; group 2--1, 5, and 0; group 3--5, 1, and 0.
9523850	8	1088	Data were analyzed by the two-sided Fisher's exact test using 95% confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf.
9523850	9	1208	These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia-myalgia syndrome.
9523850	10	1349	We conclude that 125 mg i.v. MP should be given routinely before and after TDI of iron dextran.
9545159	0	0	Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride-diltiazem interaction.
9545159	1	76	Cisapride, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders.
9545159	2	208	Prolongation of QT interval, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors.
9545159	3	419	A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem, an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension.
9545159	4	621	The patient was in near syncope and had QT-interval prolongation.
9545159	5	687	After discontinuing cisapride, the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur.
9545159	6	781	We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including diltiazem.
9549528	0	0	Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L-dopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia.
9549528	1	97	We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L-dopa medication, the first one without L-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects.
9549528	2	490	Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes.
9549528	3	578	The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas.
9549528	4	871	These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.
9564988	0	0	Open-label assessment of levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults.
9564988	1	96	PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
9564988	2	264	PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers.
9564988	3	347	All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy.
9564988	4	468	Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results.
9564988	5	587	Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s).
9564988	6	713	RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
9564988	7	853	Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%.
9564988	8	1016	Thirty-five patients (12%) clinically failed treatment.
9564988	9	1072	The microbiologic eradication rate (presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%.
9564988	10	1190	Microbiologic eradication rates (presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% (M. catarrhalis) to 100% (S. pneumoniae) at the post-therapy visit.
9564988	11	1362	All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post-therapy returned for a long-term follow-up visit; 243 (92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 (8%) had a relapse of symptoms.
9564988	12	1570	Adverse events considered to be related to levofloxacin administration were reported by 29 patients (9%).
9564988	13	1676	The most common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.
9564988	14	1814	CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that levofloxacin 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis.
9579567	0	0	Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case-control study.
9579567	1	114	F  d  ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC).
9579567	2	185	Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined.
9579567	3	365	We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study.
9579567	4	527	Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included.
9579567	5	732	Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001).
9579567	6	897	Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose.
9579567	7	1094	Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001).
9579567	8	1202	After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012).
9579567	9	1381	Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment.
9579567	10	1560	Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention.
9579567	11	1705	Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer.
9579567	12	1794	Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis.
9579567	13	1879	Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment.
9579567	14	1999	A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.
9630698	0	0	Contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in rostral and intermediate-caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats.
9630698	1	150	The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone.
9630698	2	298	Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (MMG) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior.
9630698	3	631	Muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). 5,7-DCKA injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone.
9630698	4	1176	The present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.
9636837	0	0	Carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat.
9636837	1	71	BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects.
9636837	2	211	However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage.
9636837	3	422	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats.
9636837	4	581	Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects.
9636837	5	762	RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity.
9636837	6	841	Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment.
9636837	7	972	The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons.
9636837	8	1177	Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment.
9636837	9	1294	CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.
9636837	10	1526	This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system.
9669632	0	0	Effects of cisapride on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
9669632	1	117	BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility.
9669632	2	265	Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride, on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
9669632	3	443	METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [cisapride, 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)].
9669632	4	696	RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups.
9669632	5	850	In cisapride-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo.
9669632	6	1397	No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the constipation-predominant IBS group.
9669632	7	1498	Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment.
9669632	8	1582	Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm].
9669632	9	1812	Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm].
9669632	10	2000	CONCLUSION: Cisapride affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in IBS.
9672273	0	0	Prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen: preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women.
9672273	1	128	Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study.
9672273	2	164	BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer.
9672273	3	321	Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive.
9672273	4	406	METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy.
9672273	5	599	Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years.
9672273	6	693	The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up.
9672273	7	771	In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study.
9672273	8	929	Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned.
9672273	9	1005	The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer.
9672273	10	1080	This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat.
9672273	11	1146	FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer.
9672273	12	1351	There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms.
9672273	13	1457	There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen.
9672273	14	1772	Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen.
9672273	15	1917	INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent.
9672273	16	2116	Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen.
9672273	17	2204	There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study.
9672273	18	2276	It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.
9758264	0	0	Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE (folic acid and epilepsy)
9758264	1	86	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects.
9758264	2	312	STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females.
9758264	3	412	RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period.
9758264	4	607	One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate.
9758264	5	674	Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin.
9758264	6	787	This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation.
9758264	7	943	She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes.
9758264	8	1028	Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth.
9758264	9	1065	CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures.
9758264	10	1289	Physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.
9799166	0	0	Stroke and cocaine or amphetamine use.
9799166	1	39	The association of cocaine and amphetamine use with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is based almost solely on data from case series.
9799166	2	172	The limited number of epidemiologic studies of stroke and use of cocaine and/or amphetamine have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and/or minorities.
9799166	3	337	This case-control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California.
9799166	4	478	We attempted to identify all incident strokes in women ages 15-44 years during a 3-year period using hospital admission and discharge records, emergency department logs, and payment requests for out-of-plan hospitalizations.
9799166	5	703	We selected controls, matched on age and facility of usual care, at random from healthy members of the health plan.
9799166	6	819	We obtained information in face-to-face interviews.
9799166	7	871	There were 347 confirmed stroke cases and 1,021 controls.
9799166	8	929	The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and/or amphetamine was 8.5 (95% confidence interval = 3.6-20.0).
9799166	9	1078	After further adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio in women who reported using cocaine and/or amphetamine was 7.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.8-17.9).
9799166	10	1246	The use of cocaine and/or amphetamine is a strong risk factor for stroke in this socioeconomically heterogeneous, insured urban population.
982002	0	0	Acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin.
982002	1	68	A follow-up study of cases reported earlier.
982002	2	113	A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier.
982002	3	238	The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin.
982002	4	342	The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis.
982002	5	444	Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period.
982002	6	522	The four patients re-examined were clinically cured.
982002	7	575	Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce.
982002	8	661	Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied.
982002	9	739	Renal function was normal.
982002	10	766	In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed.
982002	11	844	Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.
9848575	0	0	Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative (SM-5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs.
9848575	1	143	This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs.
9848575	2	345	In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg).
9848575	3	515	The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing.
9848575	4	577	Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations.
9848575	5	922	To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg).
9848575	6	1078	Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks.
9848575	7	1216	The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment.
9848575	8	1305	On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy.
9848575	9	1390	In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.
9867728	0	0	Risk for valvular heart disease among users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medication.
9867728	1	137	BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market.
9867728	2	339	OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications.
9867728	3	539	DESIGN: Cohort study.
9867728	4	561	SETTING: Academic primary care practices.
9867728	5	603	PATIENTS: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy.
9867728	6	735	MEASUREMENTS: Follow-up echocardiography.
9867728	7	777	The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation).
9867728	8	1066	RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving fenfluramine-phentermine developed valvular heart disease.
9867728	9	1188	One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurgitation.
9867728	10	1300	The second patient developed new moderate aortic insufficiency.
9867728	11	1364	CONCLUSION: Users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart disease.
9867728	12	1442	However, the incidence may be lower than that reported previously.
9875685	0	0	Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules.
9875685	1	91	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of tobramicyn on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity.
9875685	2	237	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. tobramycin (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups.
9875685	3	356	Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of tobramycin and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily.
9875685	4	490	Tobramycin serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay.
9875685	5	588	The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment.
9875685	6	700	RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function.
9875685	7	798	No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose.
9875685	8	913	Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%).
9875685	9	975	Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01).
9875685	10	1076	Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01).
9875685	11	1198	The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD).
9875685	12	1462	Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity.
9875685	13	1593	In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function.
9875685	14	1796	CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen.
9875685	15	1978	Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.
9915601	0	0	Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid.
9915601	1	97	High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
9915601	2	319	In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane.
9915601	3	498	Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol.
9915601	4	667	Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised.
9915601	5	762	These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone.
9915601	6	881	Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.
9952311	0	0	Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression.
9952311	1	155	The use of adriamycin (ADR) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxicity.
9952311	2	270	Earlier observations that ADR interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ADR's action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb-c mice i.p. treated with ADR for several weeks.
9952311	3	549	At various times during treatment, the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy.
9952311	4	714	In parallel, total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady-state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII, COXIII, and COXIV genes.
9952311	5	935	Similarly, samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies.
9952311	6	1037	Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia, extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling, fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.
9952311	7	1440	Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue; and 3) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined, only COXII gene expression was suppressed by ADR treatment, mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver.
9952311	8	1673	Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40% of heart muscle by weight, we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ADR on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment.
