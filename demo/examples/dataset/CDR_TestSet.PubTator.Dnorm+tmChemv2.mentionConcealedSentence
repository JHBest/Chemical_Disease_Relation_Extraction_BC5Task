10713017	1	133	The use of Doc_10713017_156_177_Chemical in Europe has been associated with the development of Doc_10713017_232_262_Disease (Doc_10713017_264_267_Chemical).
10713017	2	270	Recently, Doc_10713017_280_301_Chemical suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects.
10713017	3	434	MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with Doc_10713017_530_552_Disease at 12 large referral centers in North America.
10713017	4	600	Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the Doc_10713017_704_726_Disease and its severity.
10713017	5	745	Patients with no identifiable cause of Doc_10713017_784_806_Disease were classed as Doc_10713017_823_826_Chemical.
10713017	6	828	A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and Doc_10713017_941_953_Chemical.
10713017	7	955	Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with Doc_10713017_1022_1025_Chemical and 374 with Doc_10713017_1039_1061_Disease from other causes (Doc_10713017_1081_1113_Disease [Doc_10713017_1115_1118_Disease]).
10713017	8	1122	The use of anorexigens was common in both groups.
10713017	9	1172	However, of the medications surveyed, only the Doc_10713017_1219_1232_Chemical had a significant preferential association with Doc_10713017_1281_1284_Chemical as compared with Doc_10713017_1302_1305_Disease (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4).
10713017	10	1391	The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users.
10713017	11	1551	An unexpectedly high (11.4%) number of patients with Doc_10713017_1604_1607_Disease had used anorexigens.
10713017	12	1630	The magnitude of the association with Doc_10713017_1680_1683_Chemical, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for Doc_10713017_1770_1783_Chemical are consistent with previous studies indicating that Doc_10713017_1837_1850_Chemical are causally related to Doc_10713017_1875_1878_Chemical.
10713017	13	1880	The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with Doc_10713017_1935_1938_Disease also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate Doc_10713017_1996_2018_Disease in patients with underlying conditions associated with Doc_10713017_2074_2077_Disease.

10726030	1	111	Doc_10726030_111_118_Chemical, first used to prevent the clotting of blood in vitro, has been clinically used to treat Doc_10726030_208_218_Disease for more than 50 years.
10726030	2	243	Although several new anticoagulant drugs are in development, Doc_10726030_304_311_Chemical remains the anticoagulant of choice to treat acute Doc_10726030_363_373_Disease episodes.
10726030	3	384	The clinical effects of Doc_10726030_408_415_Chemical are meritorious, but side effects do exist.

10726030	5	512	Doc_10726030_512_526_Disease is of primary concern in patients receiving Doc_10726030_571_578_Chemical therapy.
10726030	6	588	However, additional important untoward effects of Doc_10726030_638_645_Chemical therapy include Doc_10726030_662_669_Chemical-induced Doc_10726030_678_694_Disease, Doc_10726030_696_703_Chemical-associated Doc_10726030_715_727_Disease, Doc_10726030_729_741_Disease, skin reactions, Doc_10726030_759_777_Disease other than Doc_10726030_789_805_Disease, Doc_10726030_807_815_Disease, transaminasemia, Doc_10726030_834_846_Disease, Doc_10726030_848_865_Disease, and Doc_10726030_871_879_Disease.
10726030	7	881	These side effects are relatively rare in a given individual, but given the extremely widespread use of Doc_10726030_985_992_Chemical, some are quite common, particularly HITT and Doc_10726030_1039_1051_Disease.
10726030	8	1053	Although reasonable incidences of many of these side effects can be "softly" deduced from current reports dealing with unfractionated Doc_10726030_1187_1194_Chemical, at present the incidences of these side effects with newer Doc_10726030_1255_1284_Disease appear to be much less common.
10726030	9	1316	However, only longer experience will more clearly define the incidence of each side effect with low molecular weight preparations.

10770468	2	292	A printout of all cases of Doc_10770468_319_332_Disease that presented during a 1-year period was generated.
10770468	3	386	After eliminating spurious Doc_10770468_413_427_Disease or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-Doc_10770468_503_510_Chemical-treated patients with Doc_10770468_533_547_Disease related to Doc_10770468_559_571_Disease and other medical conditions (group A) and 12 patients with Doc_10770468_632_639_Chemical-associated Doc_10770468_651_664_Disease (group B).
10770468	4	676	Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies.
10770468	5	825	Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age- and sex-comparable Doc_10770468_915_922_Chemical-treated Doc_10770468_931_952_Disease patients, and group C2, which included Doc_10770468_992_1013_Disease patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers.
10770468	6	1069	The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2.
10770468	7	1191	It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of Doc_10770468_1350_1368_Disease.
10770468	8	1370	Patients with Doc_10770468_1384_1397_Disease resulting from medical diseases and Doc_10770468_1434_1441_Disease patients with Doc_10770468_1456_1463_Chemical-associated Doc_10770468_1475_1488_Disease had significantly higher frequencies of Doc_10770468_1529_1547_Disease.
10770468	9	1549	Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups.

10933650	1	97	Doc_10933650_97_103_Chemical, a lipid nanosphere incorporating Doc_10933650_138_152_Chemical, is effective against pathogenic fungi and has low Doc_10933650_204_212_Disease.
10933650	2	214	We compared the Doc_10933650_230_238_Disease of Doc_10933650_242_248_Chemical with that of Doc_10933650_262_271_Chemical (Doc_10933650_273_287_Chemical-Doc_10933650_288_307_Chemical; Doc_10933650_309_314_Chemical) in vitro using renal cell cultures and in vivo by biochemical analysis, histopathological study of the kidney and pharmacokinetic study of Doc_10933650_455_469_Chemical following intravenous infusion of the formulation in rats.
10933650	3	529	Incubation with Doc_10933650_545_551_Chemical resulted in significantly less damage of cultured human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells compared with Doc_10933650_662_667_Chemical.
10933650	4	669	Serum blood Doc_10933650_681_685_Chemical and Doc_10933650_690_700_Chemical concentrations increased significantly in rats given an iv infusion of Doc_10933650_772_777_Chemical 3 mg/kg but not in those given the same dose of Doc_10933650_826_832_Chemical.

10939760	4	378	All patients recovered their previous normal renal function after adequate hydration and alcalinization.
10939760	5	483	A nephrostomy tube had to be placed in one of the patients for Doc_10939760_546_564_Disease in a single functional kidney.
10939760	6	596	None of them needed dialysis or a renal biopsy because of a typical benign course.
10939760	7	679	Treatment with Doc_10939760_694_706_Chemical requires exquisite control of renal function, an increase in water ingestion and possibly the alcalinization of the urine.

10975596	4	983	Resting values of LVEF, FS, +LVdP/dt, and MBP remained unchanged whatever the drug and the dosing regimen, whereas resting HR was significantly and dose-dependently lowered after Doc_10975596_1162_1173_Chemical and to a lesser extent after Doc_10975596_1203_1213_Chemical.
10975596	5	1215	Both Doc_10975596_1220_1231_Chemical and Doc_10975596_1236_1246_Chemical significantly reduced the exercise-induced Doc_10975596_1290_1301_Disease and, at the highest dose, decreased the Doc_10975596_1342_1355_Chemical-induced Doc_10975596_1364_1375_Disease.

10986547	6	542	Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively.
10986547	7	732	Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change.
10986547	8	889	Doc_10986547_898_908_Chemical-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study (last observation carried forward).
10986547	9	1269	Doc_10986547_1269_1279_Chemical-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients.
10986547	10	1451	There were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups.
10986547	11	1527	However, Doc_10986547_1536_1546_Chemical-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg, respectively) and also experienced more Doc_10986547_1733_1762_Disease (21 patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively).
10986547	12	1813	Doc_10986547_1825_1835_Chemical demonstrated greater efficacy than placebo in the treatment of acute Doc_10986547_1905_1918_Disease and was generally well tolerated.

11026989	3	371	A driving simulator (Transport Research Laboratory) was used to measure Doc_11026989_443_456_Disease (Doc_11026989_458_460_Disease), speed maintenance and steering accuracy.
11026989	4	504	Tests of basic visual function included high- and Doc_11026989_554_580_Disease (HCVA and LCVA), Pelli-Robson contrast threshold (CT) and Goldmann perimetry (FIELDS).
11026989	5	668	Useful Field of View (UFOV--a test of visual attention) was also undertaken.
11026989	6	745	The mean differences in the pre- and post-dilatation measurements were tested for statistical significance at the 95% level using one-tail paired t-tests.
11026989	7	900	Doc_11026989_909_927_Disease resulted in a statistically significant deterioration in CT and HCVA only.
11026989	8	1003	Five of 12 drivers also exhibited deterioration in LCVA, CT and Doc_11026989_1067_1069_Disease.
11026989	9	1071	Little evidence emerged for deterioration in FIELDS and UFOV.
11026989	10	1133	Also, 7 of 12 drivers appeared to adjust their driving behaviour by reducing their speed on the driving simulator, leading to improved steering accuracy.
11026989	11	1287	Doc_11026989_1300_1318_Disease may lead to a decrease in vision and daylight driving performance in young people.

11176729	2	197	Treatment with Doc_11176729_224_270_Chemical reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with Doc_11176729_320_341_Disease (Doc_11176729_343_346_Disease), but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials, primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents, especially at the recommended doses.
11176729	3	609	The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low-dose Doc_11176729_696_706_Chemical in Doc_11176729_710_713_Disease.
11176729	4	715	The Assessment of Doc_11176729_742_752_Chemical and Survival study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium-dose Doc_11176729_927_937_Chemical (12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [OD]) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- (35.0 or 32.5 mg OD) or low-dose (5.0 or 2.5 mg OD) groups.
11176729	5	1078	Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV Doc_11176729_1136_1139_Disease and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 (n = 3164) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months.
11176729	6	1274	We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment, with a focus on Doc_11176729_1405_1416_Disease and Doc_11176729_1421_1438_Disease.
11176729	7	1440	Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor, doses in only 4.2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to Doc_11176729_1636_1647_Disease (2.0%) or because of Doc_11176729_1669_1686_Disease or Doc_11176729_1690_1702_Disease (2.3%).
11176729	8	1711	Doses in more than 90% of randomized patients in the high- and low-dose groups were titrated to their assigned target, and the mean doses of blinded medication in both groups remained similar throughout the study.
11176729	9	1925	Withdrawals occurred in 27.1% of the high- and 30.7% of the low-dose groups.
11176729	10	2002	Subgroups presumed to be at higher risk for ACE inhibitor intolerance (blood pressure, <120 mm Hg; Doc_11176729_2101_2111_Chemical, > or =132.6 micromol/L [> or =1.5 mg/dL]; age, > or =70 years; and patients with Doc_11176729_2194_2202_Disease) generally tolerated the high-dose strategy.
11176729	11	2248	These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitor therapy in most patients with Doc_11176729_2337_2340_Disease can be successfully titrated to and maintained at high doses, and that more aggressive use of these agents is warranted.

11229942	3	276	Their combined Doc_11229942_291_307_Disease may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to Doc_11229942_389_401_Chemical (CE), a Doc_11229942_410_417_Chemical metabolite formed only in the presence of Doc_11229942_460_467_Chemical.
11229942	4	469	The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined Doc_11229942_543_557_Disease of Doc_11229942_561_568_Chemical and Doc_11229942_573_580_Chemical in a model simulating their abuse.
11229942	5	616	Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (IV) boluses of Doc_11229942_714_721_Chemical 7.5 mg/kg with Doc_11229942_737_744_Chemical (1 g/kg) as an IV infusion (C+E, n = 8), 2) three Doc_11229942_795_802_Chemical boluses only (C, n = 6), 3) Doc_11229942_831_838_Chemical infusion only (E, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4).

11380496	1	215	Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive Doc_11380496_298_308_Disease has been reported in patients with Doc_11380496_344_359_Disease who were treated with Doc_11380496_382_398_Chemical (Doc_11380496_400_403_Chemical).
11380496	2	406	The appearance of MPO-ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to Doc_11380496_482_485_Chemical because the titres of MPO-ANCA decreased when Doc_11380496_532_535_Chemical was stopped.
11380496	3	549	Nevertheless, there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO-ANCA and Doc_11380496_658_668_Disease during Doc_11380496_676_679_Chemical therapy, or on the incidence of MPO-ANCA in untreated Doc_11380496_734_749_Disease patients.
11380496	4	760	Therefore, we sought to address these parameters in patients with Doc_11380496_826_841_Disease.
11380496	5	843	We investigated 102 untreated patients with Doc_11380496_897_912_Disease due to Doc_11380496_920_935_Disease for the presence of MPO-ANCA, and for the development Doc_11380496_990_1000_Disease after starting Doc_11380496_1016_1019_Chemical therapy.
11380496	6	1029	Twenty-nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of Doc_11380496_1099_1102_Chemical or because the observation period was less than 3 months.
11380496	7	1161	The remaining 73 patients (55 women and 18 men), all of whom were examined for more than 3 months, were adopted as the subjects of the investigation.
11380496	8	1311	The median observation period was 23.6 months (range: 3-37 months).
11380496	9	1379	MPO-ANCA was measured at intervals of 2-6 months.
11380496	10	1443	Before treatment, the MPO-ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Doc_11380496_1511_1526_Disease patients were within the reference range (below 10 U/ml).
11380496	11	1585	Three (4.1%) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO-ANCA at 13, 16 and 17 months, respectively, after the start of Doc_11380496_1702_1705_Chemical therapy.
11380496	12	1715	In two of them, the MPO-ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U/ml, respectively, despite continued Doc_11380496_1828_1831_Chemical therapy, but no Doc_11380496_1848_1868_Disease developed.
11380496	13	1880	In the third patient, the MPO-ANCA titre increased to 204 U/ml and she developed a higher Doc_11380496_1970_1988_Disease and Doc_11380496_1993_2007_Disease, but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping Doc_11380496_2058_2061_Chemical therapy, and the MPO-ANCA titre decreased to 20.7 U/ml by 4 months after discontinuing Doc_11380496_2149_2152_Chemical.
11380496	14	2154	Doc_11380496_2167_2170_Chemical therapy may be related to the appearance of MPO-ANCA, but MPO-ANCA does not appear to be closely related to Doc_11380496_2279_2289_Disease.

11401944	1	200	This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization (EAD) in producing a trigger to initiate Doc_11401944_319_337_Disease (Doc_11401944_339_342_Disease) with Doc_11401944_349_364_Disease induced by Doc_11401944_376_386_Chemical and Doc_11401944_391_400_Chemical.
11401944	2	402	The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of Doc_11401944_524_527_Disease was also evaluated.
11401944	3	548	METHODS AND RESULTS: Transmembrane action potentials from epicardium, Doc_11401944_618_631_Chemical, and endocardium were recorded simultaneously, together with a transmural ECG, in arterially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular preparations. Doc_11401944_783_793_Chemical preferentially prolonged action potential duration (APD) in M cells dose-dependently (1 to 100 micromol/L), leading to Doc_11401944_913_928_Disease and an increase in TDR.
11401944	4	953	Doc_11401944_953_962_Chemical, however, significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol/L but shortened them at 30 micromol/L.

11401944	6	1204	Although both Doc_11401944_1218_1228_Chemical and Doc_11401944_1233_1242_Chemical rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles, they produced frequent EADs in rabbits, in which more pronounced Doc_11401944_1355_1370_Disease was seen.
11401944	7	1381	An increase in TDR by Doc_11401944_1403_1413_Chemical facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous Doc_11401944_1505_1508_Disease in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles.
11401944	8	1543	Of note, although Doc_11401944_1561_1570_Chemical (3 to 10 micromol/L) increased APD more than Doc_11401944_1616_1626_Chemical, its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally, probably because of a diminished TDR.
11401944	9	1715	This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of Doc_11401944_1931_1956_Disease.

11423811	1	146	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Doc_11423811_163_173_Disease in the setting of Doc_11423811_192_199_Chemical use poses a diagnostic dilemma.
11423811	2	232	Doc_11423811_232_242_Chemical stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating Doc_11423811_329_345_Disease.
11423811	3	347	Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of Doc_11423811_410_420_Chemical in the setting of Doc_11423811_439_446_Chemical use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with Doc_11423811_545_552_Chemical-associated Doc_11423811_564_574_Disease.
11423811	4	576	A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital.
11423811	5	727	Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used Doc_11423811_775_782_Chemical within 24 hours preceding the onset of Doc_11423811_822_832_Disease and had a normal ECG and Doc_11423811_858_868_Chemical level.
11423811	6	876	Patients exhibiting signs of continuing Doc_11423811_916_923_Chemical toxicity were excluded from the study.
11423811	7	963	All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit.
11423811	8	1095	Twenty-four patients were enrolled.
11423811	9	1140	Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate.
11423811	10	1371	Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates.
11423811	11	1443	None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding Doc_11423811_1641_1658_Disease).
11423811	12	1661	Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental Doc_11423811_1767_1775_Chemical to reach their target heart rates.
11423811	13	1811	No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when Doc_11423811_1876_1886_Chemical was administered to patients with Doc_11423811_1921_1928_Chemical-related Doc_11423811_1937_1947_Disease.

11425091	2	254	We sought to determine if prenatal Doc_11425091_289_296_Chemical exposure increases the incidence of Doc_11425091_333_351_Disease in preterm infants.
11425091	3	372	We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 premature (< 36 weeks of gestation) infants.
11425091	4	535	Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to Doc_11425091_597_604_Chemical and those not exposed to Doc_11425091_630_637_Chemical.
11425091	5	639	Infants were assigned to the Doc_11425091_668_675_Chemical-exposed group if there was a maternal history of Doc_11425091_725_732_Chemical abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery.
11425091	6	847	Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories.
11425091	7	961	The incidence of Doc_11425091_978_996_Disease in the 117 remaining infants was 14% (16 of 117).
11425091	8	1047	The incidence of Doc_11425091_1064_1082_Disease in infants exposed to Doc_11425091_1105_1112_Chemical prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with 8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (p < 0.01).
11425091	9	1204	We found an increased incidence of Doc_11425091_1252_1269_Disease formation in preterm infants who were exposed to Doc_11425091_1319_1326_Chemical prenatally.
11425091	10	1339	This result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants.

11439380	2	166	Sixty-seven men with metastatic androgen-independent Doc_11439380_219_234_Disease in an open-label trial of oral Doc_11439380_266_277_Chemical underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies (NCS) prior to and at 3-month intervals during treatment.
11439380	3	399	NCS included recording of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) from median, radial, ulnar, and sural nerves.
11439380	4	511	SNAP amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline, and the mean of the four was termed the SNAP index.
11439380	5	644	A 40% decline in the SNAP index was considered clinically significant.
11439380	6	715	Doc_11439380_715_726_Chemical was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic response.
11439380	7	793	Of 67 patients initially enrolled, 24 remained on Doc_11439380_843_854_Chemical for 3 months, 8 remained at 6 months, and 3 remained at 9 months.
11439380	8	921	Six patients developed Doc_11439380_944_954_Disease.
11439380	9	956	Clinical symptoms and a decline in the SNAP index occurred concurrently.
11439380	10	1029	Older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factors.
11439380	11	1095	Doc_11439380_1095_1105_Disease may thus be a common complication of Doc_11439380_1143_1154_Chemical in older patients.

11474137	1	97	The participation of reactive Doc_11474137_127_133_Chemical species in Doc_11474137_145_159_Chemical-induced Doc_11474137_168_179_Disease has been deduced from observations that Doc_11474137_220_234_Chemical-Doc_11474137_235_239_Chemical complexes catalyze the formation of Doc_11474137_276_286_Chemical radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate Doc_11474137_337_348_Disease in vivo.
11474137	2	358	We therefore hypothesized that overexpression of Doc_11474137_407_409_Chemical/Doc_11474137_410_412_Chemical-Doc_11474137_413_423_Chemical dismutase (h-SOD1) should protect transgenic mice from Doc_11474137_479_490_Disease.
11474137	3	492	Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h-SOD1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic C57BL/6-TgN[SOD1]3Cje mice.
11474137	4	606	Transgenic and nontransgenic littermates received Doc_11474137_656_665_Chemical (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth.
11474137	5	739	Auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth.
11474137	6	835	In nontransgenic animals, the threshold in the Doc_11474137_882_891_Chemical-treated group was 45-50 dB higher than in saline-injected controls.
11474137	7	960	In the transgenic group, Doc_11474137_985_994_Chemical increased the threshold by only 15 dB over the respective controls.
11474137	8	1063	The effects were similar at 12 and 24 kHz.
11474137	9	1106	The protection by overexpression of Doc_11474137_1142_1152_Chemical dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in Doc_11474137_1235_1249_Chemical-induced Doc_11474137_1258_1269_Disease.
11474137	10	1271	The results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention.

1158089	3	306	In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of Doc_1158089_393_405_Chemical and hepatic accumulation of Doc_1158089_434_446_Chemical.
1158089	4	448	With provision of adequate Doc_1158089_475_485_Chemical as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of Doc_1158089_585_597_Chemical and both accumulation of Doc_1158089_623_635_Chemical in the liver and Doc_1158089_653_663_Disease of output of Doc_1158089_677_689_Chemical by livers from male and female rats.
1158089	5	727	Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of Doc_1158089_849_861_Chemical and output of Doc_1158089_876_888_Chemical.
1158089	6	890	Accumulation of hepatic Doc_1158089_914_926_Chemical, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of Doc_1158089_992_1004_Chemical, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers.
1158089	7	1081	However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of Doc_1158089_1191_1203_Chemical on Doc_1158089_1207_1217_Disease of output of Doc_1158089_1231_1243_Chemical under these experimental conditions.
1158089	8	1281	These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of Doc_1158089_1364_1376_Chemical or altered uptake of Doc_1158089_1398_1408_Chemical.
1158089	9	1410	Depressed hepatic secretion of Doc_1158089_1441_1453_Chemical accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic Doc_1158089_1506_1518_Chemical, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the Doc_1158089_1600_1612_Chemical-rich Doc_1158089_1618_1629_Disease in response to Doc_1158089_1645_1657_Chemical.

11915580	2	352	However, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of Doc_11915580_474_486_Chemical (NO).
11915580	3	493	The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of Doc_11915580_555_574_Chemical (Doc_11915580_576_579_Chemical), an NO donor, in the resolution of Doc_11915580_616_636_Disease in comparison with Doc_11915580_656_666_Chemical (Doc_11915580_668_671_Chemical).
11915580	4	674	A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe Doc_11915580_726_746_Disease were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles.
11915580	5	801	In an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either Doc_11915580_887_890_Chemical per os or Doc_11915580_901_904_Chemical patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable.
11915580	6	981	In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used.
11915580	7	1035	Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg Doc_11915580_1080_1083_Chemical or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal Doc_11915580_1111_1114_Chemical for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs.
11915580	8	1176	The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs.
11915580	9	1374	The difference in Doc_11915580_1392_1396_Disease intensity score (DPI) was the main outcome variable.
11915580	10	1450	Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute (Doc_11915580_1512_1515_Chemical, -12.8 +/- 17.9; Doc_11915580_1533_1536_Chemical, -18.9 +/- 16.6).
11915580	11	1555	However, Doc_11915580_1564_1567_Chemical continued to be effective in reducing Doc_11915580_1606_1617_Disease for two hours, whereas Doc_11915580_1641_1644_Chemical scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC (after one hour: Doc_11915580_1755_1758_Chemical, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DFC, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: Doc_11915580_1817_1820_Chemical, -23.7 +/- 20.5; DFC, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001).
11915580	12	1872	Doc_11915580_1872_1885_Disease was also relieved by both drugs.
11915580	13	1919	Headache was significantly increased by Doc_11915580_1959_1962_Chemical but not by Doc_11915580_1974_1977_Chemical.
11915580	14	1979	Eight patients stopped using Doc_11915580_2008_2011_Chemical because Doc_11915580_2020_2028_Disease--attributed to its use--became intolerable.

11936424	1	156	The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of Doc_11936424_240_250_Chemical, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced Doc_11936424_334_345_Disease, inhibited Doc_11936424_357_379_Disease and prevented Doc_11936424_394_412_Disease in chronic Doc_11936424_424_449_Chemical (Doc_11936424_451_454_Chemical) - induced Doc_11936424_466_475_Disease rats.
11936424	2	482	Doc_11936424_482_491_Disease was induced by injection of Doc_11936424_520_523_Chemical (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.
11936424	3	582	Four groups were used, i) the Doc_11936424_612_615_Chemical group (14), ii) Doc_11936424_632_635_Chemical/Doc_11936424_636_646_Chemical (13), iii) Doc_11936424_658_668_Chemical (14) and iv) untreated controls (15).
11936424	4	707	Doc_11936424_707_717_Chemical (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20.
11936424	5	801	At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done.
11936424	6	972	Systolic BP in the Doc_11936424_991_994_Chemical group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the Doc_11936424_1069_1072_Chemical/Doc_11936424_1073_1083_Chemical group.
11936424	7	1091	Urinary protein excretion in the Doc_11936424_1124_1127_Chemical group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks.
11936424	8	1254	Doc_11936424_1254_1264_Chemical did not attenuate Doc_11936424_1283_1294_Disease at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20.
11936424	9	1355	The Doc_11936424_1359_1377_Disease index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the Doc_11936424_1475_1478_Chemical group.
11936424	10	1486	There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001).
11936424	11	1589	The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the Doc_11936424_1671_1674_Chemical group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the Doc_11936424_1748_1751_Chemical/Doc_11936424_1752_1762_Chemical group.
11936424	12	1770	It appears that Doc_11936424_1786_1796_Chemical was effective in Doc_11936424_1814_1841_Disease and protected renal function in Doc_11936424_1874_1877_Chemical neprotic rats.

12051122	2	449	We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of Doc_12051122_559_571_Disease and/or Doc_12051122_579_584_Disease as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of Doc_12051122_648_659_Chemical.
12051122	3	661	A total of 76 cases of Doc_12051122_693_705_Disease and/or Doc_12051122_713_718_Disease associated with Doc_12051122_735_746_Chemical use were identified.
12051122	4	768	The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients.
12051122	5	845	The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males.
12051122	6	918	Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for Doc_12051122_981_989_Disease or Doc_12051122_993_1001_Disease.
12051122	7	1003	Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian.
12051122	8	1124	Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of Doc_12051122_1201_1213_Disease and/or Doc_12051122_1221_1226_Disease associated with Doc_12051122_1243_1254_Chemical use.

12059909	1	87	The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice (DBA/2) but not in a resistant strain (C57BL/6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of Doc_12059909_304_320_Chemical (CY).
12059909	2	327	Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy.
12059909	3	570	Early CY Doc_12059909_579_587_Disease caused a typical Doc_12059909_605_626_Disease in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days.
12059909	4	692	After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic Doc_12059909_765_773_Disease appeared in 86% of DBA/2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL/6 mice.
12059909	5	836	Delayed Doc_12059909_844_852_Disease was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium.
12059909	6	999	Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA/2 mice than in C57BL/6 mice or untreated controls.
12059909	7	1154	Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells.
12059909	8	1282	Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers.
12059909	9	1430	Delayed Doc_12059909_1438_1446_Disease still persisted in DBA/2 mice 100 days after treatment.
12059909	10	1503	These results indicate that delayed Doc_12059909_1539_1547_Disease of CY in female DBA/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL/6 mice.
12059909	11	1640	This pathology resembles Doc_12059909_1665_1686_Disease in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease.

12119460	7	1001	Treatment given on an outpatient basis, using portable pump systems, was repeated on day 57.
12119460	8	1094	Patients' characteristics were: male/female ratio 20/13; median age 57 (27-75) years; median WHO status 1 (0-2). 18 patients had a primary AGC, and 15 showed a relapsed AGC.
12119460	9	1268	Median follow-up was 11.8 months (range of those surviving: 2.7-11.8 months).
12119460	10	1346	32 patients were evaluable for response - complete remission 9.1% (n = 3), partial remission 45.5% (n = 15), no change 27.3% (n = 9), progressive disease 15.1% (n = 5).
12119460	11	1524	Median overall survival time was 10.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-11.6], and median progression-free survival time was 7.6 months (95% CI: 4.4-10.9).
12119460	12	1688	The worst Doc_12119460_1698_1708_Disease (%) observed were (CTC-NCI 1/2/3): Doc_12119460_1744_1754_Disease 45.5/18.2/6.1, Doc_12119460_1770_1786_Disease 33.3/9.1/6.1, vomitus 24.2/9.1/0, diarrhea 36.4/6.1/3.0, Doc_12119460_1844_1854_Disease 18.2/9.1/0, Doc_12119460_1867_1885_Disease 12.1/0/0.

12359538	6	730	Outcomes included Doc_12359538_748_756_Disease (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, Doc_12359538_832_845_Disease, and significant Doc_12359538_863_879_Disease (>or=50%).
12359538	7	891	Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for Doc_12359538_962_964_Disease and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations.
12359538	8	999	Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%).
12359538	9	1116	Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for Doc_12359538_1218_1220_Disease, and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL.
12359538	10	1272	Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting Doc_12359538_1361_1374_Disease or significant disease were high for both Doc_12359538_1417_1425_Disease and cTnI and were not significantly different.
12359538	11	1473	Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for Doc_12359538_1545_1547_Disease, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease.
12359538	12	1617	Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing Doc_12359538_1711_1719_Disease in patients with Doc_12359538_1737_1744_Chemical-associated Doc_12359538_1756_1766_Disease and suspected Doc_12359538_1781_1783_Disease.

12487093	1	92	The asymmetrical breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was studied in female rats.
12487093	2	180	Paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test.
12487093	3	233	Doc_12487093_233_243_Chemical-induced Doc_12487093_252_264_Disease was used to destroy the BBB, which was evaluated using Doc_12487093_320_340_Chemical (TTC) staining of the brain slices just after giving Doc_12487093_394_404_Chemical for 30 s.
12487093	4	415	In normal rats, the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with TTC.
12487093	5	494	After Doc_12487093_500_510_Chemical infusion for 30 s, there were large unstained areas in the left brain in right-pawed animals, and vice versa in left-pawed animals.
12487093	6	643	Similar results were obtained in Doc_12487093_676_683_Disease-induced breakdown of BBB.
12487093	7	710	These results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rats.
12487093	8	819	It was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals.

12498738	5	816	Heart mitochondria isolated from Doc_12498738_849_860_Chemical-treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration (336 +/- 26 versus 425 +/- 53 natom O/min/mg protein) and a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (4.3 +/- 0.6 versus 5.8 +/- 0.4) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline-treated rats.
12498738	6	1125	Mitochondrial Doc_12498738_1139_1146_Chemical-loading capacity and the activity of Doc_12498738_1184_1188_Chemical-dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from Doc_12498738_1253_1264_Chemical-treated rats.
12498738	7	1279	Doc_12498738_1279_1290_Chemical treatment also caused a decrease in RCR for Doc_12498738_1335_1353_Disease (3.9 +/- 0.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.7 for control rats) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activity.
12498738	8	1459	Coadministration of Doc_12498738_1479_1489_Chemical decreased the extent of cellular vacuolization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of Doc_12498738_1596_1607_Chemical on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and liver.
12498738	9	1662	Doc_12498738_1662_1672_Chemical also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial Doc_12498738_1718_1724_Chemical loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of Doc_12498738_1793_1811_Disease caused by Doc_12498738_1822_1833_Chemical.
12498738	10	1835	Doc_12498738_1835_1845_Chemical by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or Doc_12498738_1915_1933_Disease.
12498738	11	1935	It is concluded that this protection by Doc_12498738_1975_1985_Chemical against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose-limiting Doc_12498738_2125_2150_Disease and Doc_12498738_2155_2169_Disease that accompanies long-term Doc_12498738_2197_2208_Chemical therapy in Doc_12498738_2220_2226_Disease patients.

12523489	1	120	The influence of Doc_12523489_137_146_Chemical receptor agonists and antagonists on Doc_12523489_184_191_Chemical-and Doc_12523489_196_207_Chemical-induced Doc_12523489_216_229_Disease was examined in mice.
12523489	2	252	All Doc_12523489_256_265_Chemical receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent.
12523489	3	377	It seems that Doc_12523489_391_400_Chemical A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction.
12523489	4	457	Moreover, all Doc_12523489_471_480_Chemical receptor agonists: Doc_12523489_500_565_Chemical (Doc_12523489_567_576_Chemical), A2A receptor agonist, Doc_12523489_601_624_Chemical (Doc_12523489_626_629_Chemical), A1 receptor agonist, and Doc_12523489_657_687_Chemical (Doc_12523489_689_693_Chemical), A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased Doc_12523489_764_771_Chemical-induced locomotor activity.
12523489	5	800	Doc_12523489_800_803_Chemical reduced Doc_12523489_812_819_Chemical action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while Doc_12523489_894_903_Chemical and Doc_12523489_908_912_Chemical decreased the action of Doc_12523489_937_944_Chemical at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals.
12523489	6	1019	These results suggest the involvement of both Doc_12523489_1065_1074_Chemical receptors in the action of Doc_12523489_1102_1109_Chemical although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it.

12523489	8	1344	Doc_12523489_1344_1352_Chemical had similar action but the effect was not significant.
12523489	9	1408	Doc_12523489_1408_1411_Chemical (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test.
12523489	10	1506	Similarly, all Doc_12523489_1521_1530_Chemical receptor agonists decreased Doc_12523489_1559_1570_Chemical-induced Doc_12523489_1579_1592_Disease, but at the higher doses than those which were active in Doc_12523489_1650_1657_Chemical-induced Doc_12523489_1666_1679_Disease.
12523489	11	1681	The selective blockade of A2 Doc_12523489_1710_1719_Chemical receptors (Doc_12523489_1731_1735_Chemical) and non-selective blockade of Doc_12523489_1767_1776_Chemical receptors (Doc_12523489_1788_1796_Chemical) significantly increased the action of Doc_12523489_1836_1847_Chemical in the locomotor activity test.
12523489	12	1880	Our results have shown that all Doc_12523489_1912_1921_Chemical receptor agonists (A1 and A2) reduce Doc_12523489_1959_1966_Chemical- and Doc_12523489_1972_1983_Chemical-induced locomotor activity and indicate that Doc_12523489_2029_2036_Chemical-induced Doc_12523489_2045_2058_Disease is more influenced by Doc_12523489_2081_2090_Chemical receptor agonists (particularly A1 receptors) than Doc_12523489_2142_2153_Chemical-induced Doc_12523489_2162_2175_Disease.

12535818	1	151	The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of Doc_12535818_221_231_Chemical in patients with Doc_12535818_249_268_Disease (Doc_12535818_270_272_Disease) increases the risk of Doc_12535818_296_311_Disease requiring a permanent pacemaker.
12535818	2	345	Reports of severe Doc_12535818_375_390_Disease during Doc_12535818_398_408_Chemical therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy's use in the management of patients with Doc_12535818_518_541_Disease.
12535818	3	543	A study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of Doc_12535818_628_630_Disease was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a Doc_12535818_702_723_Disease (Doc_12535818_725_727_Disease) between 1991 and 1999.
12535818	4	752	Using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of Doc_12535818_801_816_Disease requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1:4) to 1,908 controls.
12535818	5	887	Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of pacemaker insertion associated with Doc_12535818_1001_1011_Chemical use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to Doc_12535818_1071_1078_Chemical, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, Doc_12535818_1126_1133_Chemical channel blockers, and Doc_12535818_1156_1163_Chemical.
12535818	6	1165	Doc_12535818_1174_1184_Chemical use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 3.54).
12535818	7	1306	This effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (OR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.70 to 8.75 vs. OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.89).
12535818	8	1451	Doc_12535818_1451_1458_Chemical was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.31).
12535818	9	1580	This study suggests that the use of Doc_12535818_1629_1639_Chemical in elderly patients with Doc_12535818_1665_1667_Disease and a previous Doc_12535818_1683_1685_Disease increases the risk of Doc_12535818_1708_1723_Disease requiring a permanent pacemaker.
12535818	10	1757	The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving Doc_12535818_1840_1850_Chemical requires further investigation.

12559315	5	666	The animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studies.
12559315	6	764	The light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high-dose group.
12559315	7	894	When compared with the control group, both Doc_12559315_937_949_Chemical groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa (P <0.0001) and penetration of Doc_12559315_1057_1074_Chemical through intercellular areas of the epithelium.
12559315	8	1122	Furthermore, the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant (P <0.0001).
12559315	9	1263	Doc_12559315_1276_1288_Chemical resulted in histopathologic findings typical of Doc_12559315_1337_1358_Disease, such as leaky bladder epithelium and Doc_12559315_1397_1417_Disease.

12677626	2	302	Doc_12677626_302_317_Chemical, the pure S(-) enantiomer of Doc_12677626_347_358_Chemical, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of Doc_12677626_415_426_Chemical.
12677626	3	428	We describe 2 cases of grand mal Doc_12677626_461_469_Disease following accidental intravascular injection of Doc_12677626_518_533_Chemical.
12677626	4	535	CASE REPORT: Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach.
12677626	5	690	Immediately after the administration of Doc_12677626_730_745_Chemical 0.5% with Doc_12677626_756_767_Chemical 2.5 microgram/mL, the patients developed grand mal Doc_12677626_819_827_Disease, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous Doc_12677626_904_915_Chemical administration.
12677626	6	932	The Doc_12677626_936_944_Disease were successfully treated with Doc_12677626_976_993_Chemical in addition to Doc_12677626_1009_1024_Chemical in 1 patient.
12677626	7	1039	Neither patient developed signs of Doc_12677626_1074_1097_Disease.
12677626	8	1099	Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of Doc_12677626_1286_1301_Chemical with Doc_12677626_1307_1318_Chemical.
12677626	9	1320	Although Doc_12677626_1342_1357_Chemical may have a safer Doc_12677626_1375_1391_Disease profile than racemic Doc_12677626_1413_1424_Chemical, if adequate amounts of Doc_12677626_1449_1464_Chemical reach the circulation, it will result in Doc_12677626_1506_1517_Disease.
12677626	10	1519	Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in Doc_12677626_1565_1596_Disease did not produce manifestations of Doc_12677626_1631_1647_Disease in these 2 patients.
12678199	0	0	Doc_12678199_0_10_Chemical-induced Doc_12678199_19_37_Disease during bladder irrigation: an unusual presentation--a case report.
12678199	1	105	The authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of Doc_12678199_172_190_Disease (Doc_12678199_192_195_Disease) associated with oral Doc_12678199_218_228_Chemical therapy.
12678199	2	238	Consistent with other reports this case of Doc_12678199_281_284_Disease occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including Doc_12678199_352_363_Disease and Doc_12678199_368_375_Chemical excess.
12678199	3	384	Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of Doc_12678199_467_470_Disease.
12678199	4	472	It is well known that Doc_12678199_494_505_Disease exacerbates acquired Doc_12678199_527_530_Disease.
12678199	5	532	The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of Doc_12678199_647_657_Chemical therapy resulted in Doc_12678199_678_688_Chemical-induced proarrhythmia.
12678199	6	712	In the absence of Doc_12678199_730_740_Chemical therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce Doc_12678199_793_796_Disease despite Doc_12678199_805_816_Disease and Doc_12678199_821_835_Disease.
12699527	0	0	Anaesthetic complications associated with Doc_12699527_42_50_Disease congenita: case study and comparison with other Doc_12699527_99_117_Disease.
12699527	1	119	Doc_12699527_119_127_Disease congenita (MC) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle Doc_12699527_188_196_Chemical channel function, which may cause sustained membrane depolarisation.
12699527	2	266	We describe a previously healthy 32-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening muscle Doc_12699527_357_362_Disease and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of Doc_12699527_440_453_Chemical.
12699527	3	455	The muscle Doc_12699527_466_472_Disease disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further problems.
12699527	4	551	When subsequently questioned, she reported minor symptoms suggesting a Doc_12699527_622_630_Disease condition.
12699527	5	642	Doc_12699527_642_650_Disease was found on clinical examination and EMG.
12699527	6	694	The diagnosis MC was confirmed genetically.
12699527	7	738	Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist were aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred.
12699527	8	861	We give a brief overview of ion channel disorders including Doc_12699527_921_943_Disease and their anaesthetic considerations.
12752472	0	0	Respiratory pattern in a rat model of Doc_12752472_38_46_Disease.
12752472	1	48	Doc_12752472_57_62_Disease is known to occur during Doc_12752472_88_96_Disease, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few.
12752472	2	169	Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce.
12752472	3	255	Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with Doc_12752472_347_358_Chemical-induced Doc_12752472_367_375_Disease.
12752472	4	377	Twelve rats (six chronically Doc_12752472_415_424_Disease animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or Doc_12752472_528_543_Disease conditions.
12752472	5	556	Doc_12752472_556_575_Disease caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph.
12752472	6	669	This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) on a breath-by-breath basis.
12752472	7	997	The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in Doc_12752472_1084_1095_Chemical-treated and control rats.
12752472	8	1122	Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the Doc_12752472_1180_1189_Disease group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals.
12752472	9	1316	The Doc_12752472_1320_1335_Disease maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE.
12752472	10	1418	In the Doc_12752472_1425_1434_Disease group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group.
12752472	11	1555	Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups.
12752472	12	1713	The data indicate that Doc_12752472_1749_1760_Chemical-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined.
12752472	13	1924	We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different Doc_12752472_2008_2016_Disease-associated conditions.
1280054	0	0	Fatal myeloencephalopathy due to intrathecal Doc_1280054_45_56_Chemical administration.
1280054	1	73	Doc_1280054_73_84_Chemical was accidentally given intrathecally to a child with Doc_1280054_138_147_Disease, producing Doc_1280054_159_188_Disease followed by Doc_1280054_201_215_Disease and Doc_1280054_220_225_Disease.
1280054	2	227	Separate times for administering Doc_1280054_260_271_Chemical and intrathecal therapy is recommended.
1280707	0	0	Doc_1280707_0_12_Chemical potentiation of Doc_1280707_29_40_Chemical arrhythmogenicity in Doc_1280707_62_75_Chemical-anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cultures.
1280707	1	131	The effects of Doc_1280707_146_158_Chemical treatment on Doc_1280707_172_183_Chemical arrhythmogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determined.
1280707	2	282	After determining the Doc_1280707_304_315_Chemical AD50 (the concentration of Doc_1280707_343_354_Chemical that caused 50% of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic), we determined the effect of 1-hour Doc_1280707_471_487_Chemical exposure on myocyte contractile rhythm.
1280707	3	528	Each concentration of Doc_1280707_550_562_Chemical (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 micrograms/ml) caused a significant and concentration-dependent reduction in the AD50 for Doc_1280707_677_688_Chemical.
1280707	4	690	Doc_1280707_690_699_Chemical treatment also increased the arrhythmogenicity of Doc_1280707_750_761_Chemical in myocyte cultures, but was only one fourth as potent as Doc_1280707_820_832_Chemical.
1280707	5	834	Neither Doc_1280707_842_854_Chemical nor Doc_1280707_859_868_Chemical effects on Doc_1280707_880_891_Chemical arrhythmogenicity were potentiated by Doc_1280707_930_941_Chemical.
1280707	6	943	Chronic Doc_1280707_951_963_Chemical pretreatment (5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) caused a significant increase in Doc_1280707_1036_1047_Chemical arrhythmogenicity in intact Doc_1280707_1076_1089_Chemical-anesthetized rats.
1280707	7	1109	There was a significant decrease in the time to onset of Doc_1280707_1166_1176_Disease as compared with control Doc_1280707_1202_1217_Chemical-treated rats (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 30.8 +/- 2.5 min, mean +/- SE).
1280707	8	1280	The results of this study indicate that Doc_1280707_1320_1332_Chemical can potentiate Doc_1280707_1348_1359_Chemical arrhythmogenicity both in vivo and in vitro.
1280707	9	1405	Potentiation of Doc_1280707_1421_1432_Chemical Doc_1280707_1433_1443_Disease in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level.
12828076	0	0	Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with Doc_12828076_45_64_Disease due to Doc_12828076_72_83_Chemical Doc_12828076_84_92_Disease.
12828076	1	94	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of Doc_12828076_251_270_Disease.
12828076	2	272	The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with Doc_12828076_353_372_Disease.
12828076	3	374	Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with Doc_12828076_465_484_Disease and 10 normal control subjects.
12828076	4	517	Serum levels of Doc_12828076_533_538_Disease Doc_12828076_539_547_Disease factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA.
12828076	5	613	Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with Doc_12828076_678_697_Disease (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001).
12828076	6	826	Levels were significantly greater in patients with Doc_12828076_877_896_Disease due to Doc_12828076_904_915_Chemical Doc_12828076_916_924_Disease (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E Doc_12828076_1005_1014_Disease (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01).
12828076	7	1075	There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients.
12828076	8	1146	A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and Doc_12828076_1215_1224_Chemical aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01).
12828076	9	1265	The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with Doc_12828076_1340_1359_Disease may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased Doc_12828076_1455_1460_Disease Doc_12828076_1461_1469_Disease factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.
12865514	0	0	Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Doc_12865514_46_65_Disease.
12865514	1	67	High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Doc_12865514_185_204_Disease.
12865514	2	206	We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients.
12865514	3	283	Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Doc_12865514_335_354_Disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly Doc_12865514_412_424_Disease, Doc_12865514_426_434_Disease, and Doc_12865514_440_448_Chemical-induced Doc_12865514_457_468_Disease underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN.
12865514	4	528	Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in "on" and "off" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Doc_12865514_690_709_Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings.
12865514	5	811	After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Doc_12865514_963_982_Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005).
12865514	6	1078	The subscores for the Doc_12865514_1100_1108_Disease, Doc_12865514_1110_1118_Disease, Doc_12865514_1120_1126_Disease and gait also improved. (p<0.0005).
12865514	7	1163	The average Doc_12865514_1175_1183_Chemical dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg.
12865514	8	1222	The cognitive functions remained unchanged.
12865514	9	1266	Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal Doc_12865514_1356_1367_Disease.
12865514	10	1369	Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Doc_12865514_1462_1481_Disease.
12865514	11	1483	It reduces the severity of "off" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces Doc_12865514_1572_1580_Chemical requirements.
12865514	12	1595	The reduction in the Doc_12865514_1616_1624_Chemical dose is useful in controlling drug-induced Doc_12865514_1668_1679_Disease.
1289188	0	0	Doc_1289188_0_19_Disease occurring during intravenous Doc_1289188_49_64_Chemical therapy: recovery after haemodialysis.
1289188	1	104	A patient with transfusion-dependent Doc_1289188_141_152_Disease was undergoing home intravenous Doc_1289188_185_200_Chemical (Doc_1289188_202_205_Chemical) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the nightly subcutaneous therapy.
1289188	2	326	Due to an accidental malfunctioning of the infusion pump, the patient was inadvertently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused Doc_1289188_467_486_Disease.
1289188	3	488	Given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values, despite adequate medical treatment, a decision was made to introduce haemodialytical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephrotoxicity.
1289188	4	730	From the results obtained, haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive Doc_1289188_847_866_Disease caused by Doc_1289188_877_892_Chemical.
12912689	0	0	Ocular motility changes after subtenon Doc_12912689_39_50_Chemical chemotherapy for Doc_12912689_68_82_Disease.
12912689	1	84	Focal subtenon Doc_12912689_111_122_Chemical injections have recently been used as a presumably Doc_12912689_174_182_Disease-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for Doc_12912689_225_251_Disease.
12912689	2	253	To report our clinical experience with Doc_12912689_303_327_Disease in patients treated with Doc_12912689_353_373_Chemical chemotherapy.
12912689	3	388	We noted Doc_12912689_406_430_Disease in 10 consecutive patients with Doc_12912689_463_477_Disease who had received subtenon Doc_12912689_504_515_Chemical.
12912689	4	517	During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after Doc_12912689_652_657_Disease control with ocular motility at diagnosis.
12912689	5	701	Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically.
12912689	6	797	Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for Doc_12912689_891_917_Disease with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon Doc_12912689_953_964_Chemical as part of multimodality therapy.
12912689	7	999	Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat Doc_12912689_1200_1208_Disease.
12912689	8	1210	The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for Doc_12912689_1272_1285_Disease because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions.
12912689	9	1338	Subtenon Doc_12912689_1360_1371_Chemical chemotherapy is associated with significant Doc_12912689_1416_1424_Disease of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult.
12912689	10	1546	Subtenon Doc_12912689_1555_1566_Chemical is not free of Doc_12912689_1582_1590_Disease, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.

12948256	3	323	The clinical characteristics and Doc_12948256_356_387_Disease were analyzed to determine visual outcome.
12948256	4	431	All patients had Doc_12948256_457_473_Disease between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting Doc_12948256_531_541_Chemical therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day).
12948256	5	617	Seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug.
12948256	6	701	Of 6 patients with irreversible Doc_12948256_733_750_Disease, 4 patients had Doc_12948256_767_784_Disease, Doc_12948256_786_794_Disease and a history of heavy smoking.
12948256	7	827	Early recognition of Doc_12948256_860_876_Disease should be considered in patients with Doc_12948256_915_925_Chemical therapy.
12948256	8	935	A low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with Doc_12948256_1033_1050_Disease, Doc_12948256_1052_1060_Disease or who are heavy smokers.

12950111	2	203	Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs, the topical application of anticholinergics or Doc_12950111_315_332_Chemical, and the injection of botulinum toxin.
12950111	3	372	Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical Doc_12950111_440_454_Chemical.
12950111	4	456	All patients had Doc_12950111_473_496_Disease, which interfered with their social activities, after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy, and which was associated with compensatory focal Doc_12950111_640_653_Disease.
12950111	5	655	After applying topical Doc_12950111_678_692_Chemical, the subjective effect was excellent (no sweating after eating hot spicy food) in 10 patients (77%), and fair (clearly reduced sweating) in 3 patients (23%).
12950111	6	851	All had reported incidents of being very embarrassed whilst eating hot spicy foods.
12950111	7	935	Adverse effects included a mildly Doc_12950111_969_978_Disease and a sore throat in 2 patients (2% Doc_12950111_1015_1029_Chemical), a light Doc_12950111_1040_1048_Disease in 1 patient (1.5% Doc_12950111_1068_1082_Chemical).
12950111	8	1085	The topical application of a Doc_12950111_1114_1128_Chemical pad appeared to be safe, efficacious, well tolerated, and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of Doc_12950111_1255_1278_Disease in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympathicotomy patients, with few side effects.

1359137	2	81	Six stable Doc_1359137_92_103_Disease outpatients with Doc_1359137_121_139_Disease and Doc_1359137_144_154_Disease/Doc_1359137_155_169_Disease associated with their neuroleptic medications were treated with Doc_1359137_234_247_Chemical.
1359137	3	249	Daily dosages of 5-10 mg corrected the Doc_1359137_288_306_Disease and restored menstruation in four of the six patients.
1359137	4	362	One woman, however, developed worsened Doc_1359137_401_412_Disease symptoms while taking Doc_1359137_435_448_Chemical, and it was discontinued.
1359137	5	475	Thus, three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with Doc_1359137_564_577_Chemical.
1359137	6	579	This suggests that Doc_1359137_598_611_Chemical should be further evaluated as potential therapy for neuroleptic-associated Doc_1359137_688_706_Disease and Doc_1359137_711_721_Disease/Doc_1359137_722_734_Disease.

1361574	1	169	In rodents, the effect of the Doc_1361574_199_213_Chemical derivative Doc_1361574_225_292_Chemical (Doc_1361574_294_304_Chemical), a new ligand for Doc_1361574_324_338_Chemical receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was evaluated on the function of central Doc_1361574_443_466_Chemical (Doc_1361574_468_472_Chemical)A receptor complex, both in vitro and in vivo.
1361574	2	520	Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, Doc_1361574_573_582_Chemical increased [3H]Doc_1361574_597_601_Chemical binding, enhanced Doc_1361574_620_645_Chemical uptake and reduced the binding of Doc_1361574_680_716_Chemical (Doc_1361574_718_727_Chemical).
1361574	3	730	These effects were similar to those induced by Doc_1361574_777_785_Chemical, whereas the partial agonist Doc_1361574_815_825_Chemical (Doc_1361574_827_947_Chemical) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests.
1361574	4	1003	After i.p. injection to rats, Doc_1361574_1033_1042_Chemical and Doc_1361574_1047_1055_Chemical decreased in a time-dependent and dose-related (0.25-20 mg/kg i.p.) manner Doc_1361574_1131_1140_Chemical binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex.
1361574	5	1190	Moreover, both drugs at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by Doc_1361574_1332_1342_Chemical (350 mg/kg s.c.) as well as the increase of Doc_1361574_1387_1396_Chemical binding induced by foot-shock stress.
1361574	6	1435	To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects, we studied the action of Doc_1361574_1529_1538_Chemical on Doc_1361574_1542_1551_Chemical binding, exploratory motility and on Doc_1361574_1589_1598_Chemical-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice.
1361574	7	1656	In these animals, Doc_1361574_1674_1683_Chemical produced a paralleled dose-dependent (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.) reduction of both motor behavior and cortical [35S]TBPS binding.
1361574	8	1806	Moreover, 0.05 mg/kg of this Doc_1361574_1835_1849_Chemical reduced markedly the increase of Doc_1361574_1883_1892_Chemical binding and the Doc_1361574_1909_1920_Disease induced by Doc_1361574_1932_1941_Chemical (200 mg/kg s.c.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

1395192	4	327	Our case (including an inadvertent rechallenge) suggests such a relationship.
1395192	5	405	Although generally regarded as "safe," possible serious cardiac effects of Doc_1395192_480_493_Chemical should be acknowledged.
1420650	0	0	Asterixis induced by Doc_1420650_21_34_Chemical therapy.
1420650	1	44	There are very few reports about Doc_1420650_77_86_Disease as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents.
1420650	2	150	In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs, in whom Doc_1420650_258_267_Disease was triggered either by adding Doc_1420650_299_312_Chemical (Doc_1420650_314_317_Chemical) to a treatment regimen, or by increasing its dosage.
1420650	3	372	Neither dosage nor serum levels of Doc_1420650_407_410_Chemical were in a higher range.
1420650	4	435	We consider Doc_1420650_447_456_Disease to be an easily overlooked sign of Doc_1420650_492_505_Disease, which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels, if certain drugs as Doc_1420650_582_589_Chemical or Doc_1420650_593_602_Chemical are used in combination with Doc_1420650_632_635_Chemical.

1423336	1	81	Blood pressure effects of i.v. Doc_1423336_112_120_Chemical were examined in Doc_1423336_138_150_Disease patients with stable and fluctuating responses to Doc_1423336_201_209_Chemical.
1423336	2	211	The magnitude of the Doc_1423336_232_243_Disease effect of Doc_1423336_254_262_Chemical was concentration dependent and was fit to an Emax model in fluctuating responders.
1423336	3	347	Stable responders demonstrated a small Doc_1423336_386_397_Disease response.
1423336	4	408	Baseline blood pressures were higher in fluctuating patients; a higher baseline blood pressure correlated with greater Doc_1423336_527_538_Disease effects.
1423336	5	548	Antiparkinsonian effects of Doc_1423336_576_584_Chemical temporally correlated with blood pressure changes.
1423336	6	636	Doc_1423336_636_649_Chemical, a large neutral Doc_1423336_667_677_Chemical (Doc_1423336_679_683_Chemical) competing with Doc_1423336_700_708_Chemical for transport across the blood-brain barrier, reduced the Doc_1423336_767_778_Disease and antiparkinsonian effects of Doc_1423336_811_819_Chemical.
1423336	7	821	We conclude that Doc_1423336_838_846_Chemical has a central Doc_1423336_861_872_Disease action that parallels the motor effects in fluctuating patients.
1423336	8	938	The Doc_1423336_942_953_Disease effect appears to be related to the higher baseline blood pressure we observed in fluctuating patients relative to stable patients.

1424076	1	90	A 77-year-old woman with refractory multiple Doc_1424076_135_142_Disease was treated with a 4-day continuous intravenous infusion of Doc_1424076_203_214_Chemical and Doc_1424076_219_230_Chemical and 4 days of oral Doc_1424076_250_263_Chemical.
1424076	2	265	Nine days after her second cycle she presented with lethargy and Doc_1424076_330_338_Disease associated with Doc_1424076_355_367_Disease.
1424076	3	369	Evaluation revealed the Doc_1424076_393_452_Disease, which was attributed to the Doc_1424076_482_493_Chemical infusion.
1424076	4	504	After normal serum Doc_1424076_523_529_Chemical levels returned, further Doc_1424076_555_566_Chemical and Doc_1424076_571_584_Chemical chemotherapy without Doc_1424076_606_617_Chemical did not produce this complication.

1449452	2	55	Despite extensive clinical experience the role of Doc_1449452_105_112_Chemical is still not well defined.
1449452	3	140	In patients with Doc_1449452_157_176_Disease Doc_1449452_177_184_Chemical is beneficial for ventricular rate control.
1449452	4	229	For patients in sinus rhythm and Doc_1449452_262_275_Disease the situation is less clear.
1449452	5	305	Doc_1449452_305_312_Chemical has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs.
1449452	6	404	Also, Doc_1449452_410_417_Chemical has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing Doc_1449452_519_530_Disease.
1449452	7	532	There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials.
1449452	8	586	The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit.
1449452	9	708	More convincing evidence is required showing that Doc_1449452_758_765_Chemical improves symptoms or exercise capacity.
1449452	10	806	Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality.
1449452	11	876	Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that Doc_1449452_990_997_Chemical may increase mortality after Doc_1449452_1027_1048_Disease (Doc_1449452_1050_1052_Disease).
1449452	12	1055	Doc_1449452_1055_1101_Chemical should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality.
1449452	13	1279	Caution should be exercised in using Doc_1449452_1316_1323_Chemical until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm.
1449452	14	1399	Until then Doc_1449452_1410_1417_Chemical should be considered a third-line therapy.

15229250	1	82	We visualize, for the first time, the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic Doc_15229250_194_209_Chemical (MA) abuse.
15229250	2	222	Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed Doc_15229250_291_377_Disease.
15229250	3	379	Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and new computational brain-mapping techniques, we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic Doc_15229250_548_556_Disease in human subjects and related these Doc_15229250_593_625_Disease.
15229250	4	627	We used high-resolution MRI and surface-based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age-matched, healthy controls.
15229250	5	860	Cortical maps revealed severe Doc_15229250_890_910_Disease in the cingulate, limbic, and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers (averaging 11.3% below control; p < 0.05).
15229250	6	1018	On average, MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects (p < 0.01; left, p = 0.01; right, p < 0.05) and significant white-matter Doc_15229250_1173_1184_Disease (7.0%; p < 0.01).
15229250	7	1203	Doc_15229250_1203_1223_Disease were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word-recall test (p < 0.05).
15229250	8	1309	MRI-based maps suggest that chronic Doc_15229250_1345_1360_Chemical abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance.
15229250	9	1469	MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and, consistent with metabolic studies, the cingulate-limbic cortex, inducing neuroadaptation, Doc_15229250_1615_1633_Disease, or cell death.

15265979	0	0	Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after Doc_15265979_54_64_Chemical treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha target gene activation.
15265979	1	167	Doc_15265979_167_177_Chemical, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients.
15265979	2	292	To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of Doc_15265979_392_402_Chemical and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation.
15265979	3	470	Doc_15265979_470_480_Chemical induced Doc_15265979_489_501_Disease, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum Doc_15265979_585_598_Chemical and Doc_15265979_603_610_Chemical.
15265979	4	612	Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for Doc_15265979_737_747_Chemical oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport.
15265979	5	802	Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor.
15265979	6	971	The absence of induction of these genes as well as Doc_15265979_1022_1034_Disease in PPARalpha knockout [PPARalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of Doc_15265979_1107_1117_Chemical were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene.
15265979	7	1183	Compared to wild-type mice, treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with Doc_15265979_1247_1257_Chemical resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body Doc_15265979_1313_1324_Disease.
15265979	8	1326	The inability of Doc_15265979_1343_1353_Chemical to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 Doc_15265979_1444_1452_Disease cells indicates that the effects of Doc_15265979_1489_1499_Chemical on the function of this receptor were indirect.
15265979	9	1548	Based upon these results, we conclude that Doc_15265979_1591_1601_Chemical disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect.
15265979	10	1732	These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of Doc_15265979_1829_1839_Chemical and indicate that PPARalpha protects against Doc_15265979_1885_1895_Chemical-induced hepatotoxicity.

15605432	4	651	Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle.
15605432	5	866	Analysis of 4HNE protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4HNE protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3NT levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours.
15605432	6	1193	Our data showed Doc_15605432_1209_1212_Chemical induced 4HNE-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when Doc_15605432_1289_1309_Disease initially appeared.
15605432	7	1330	These results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage.

15614572	5	851	We also investigated whether Doc_15614572_880_889_Chemical induces Doc_15614572_898_907_Disease in rats.
15614572	6	917	Doc_15614572_926_935_Chemical at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce Doc_15614572_972_981_Disease, and did not antagonize Doc_15614572_1006_1017_Chemical (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and Doc_15614572_1051_1062_Chemical (0.05 mg/kg)-induced Doc_15614572_1084_1093_Disease.
15614572	7	1095	However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. Doc_15614572_1146_1155_Chemical enhanced Doc_15614572_1165_1179_Chemical stereotypy, and antagonized Doc_15614572_1208_1219_Chemical Doc_15614572_1220_1229_Disease, Doc_15614572_1231_1242_Chemical-induced WDS behavior and Doc_15614572_1268_1278_Chemical-induced penile erections.
15614572	8	1305	Doc_15614572_1305_1314_Chemical at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced Doc_15614572_1351_1360_Disease and antagonized Doc_15614572_1377_1388_Chemical and Doc_15614572_1393_1407_Chemical stereotypies.
15614572	9	1422	Our results indicate that Doc_15614572_1461_1470_Chemical at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors.
15614572	10	1628	Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, Doc_15614572_1664_1673_Chemical blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors.
15614572	11	1712	We suggest that Doc_15614572_1728_1737_Chemical (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by Doc_15614572_1870_1874_Chemical, and thereby potentiates Doc_15614572_1900_1914_Chemical stereotypy and antagonizes Doc_15614572_1942_1953_Chemical Doc_15614572_1954_1963_Disease.

15625689	5	610	Deglutition was assessed using modified barium swallow with videofluoroscopy.
15625689	6	688	Nondyskinetic patients, but not the Doc_15625689_724_734_Disease ones, showed less oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency (OPSE) for liquid food than controls (Dunnett, P = 0.02).
15625689	7	847	Doc_15625689_847_857_Disease patients tended to have a greater OPSE than nondyskinetic (Dunnett, P = 0.06).
15625689	8	937	Patients who were using a higher dose of Doc_15625689_978_986_Chemical had a greater OPSE and a trend toward a smaller oral transit time (Pearson's correlation, P = 0.01 and 0.08, respectively).
15625689	9	1111	Neither the report of Doc_15625689_1133_1142_Disease nor any of the Doc_15625689_1158_1160_Disease severity parameters correlated to the videofluoroscopic variables.
15625689	10	1228	In the current study, Doc_15625689_1250_1260_Disease patients performed better in swallowing function, which could be explained on the basis of a greater Doc_15625689_1362_1370_Chemical dose.
15625689	11	1377	Our results suggest a role for Doc_15625689_1408_1416_Chemical in the oral phase of deglutition and confirm that Doc_15625689_1467_1476_Disease is not a good predictor of deglutition alterations in Doc_15625689_1531_1533_Disease.

15696449	10	1168	Univariate analysis identified age, Doc_15696449_1204_1219_Disease, heavy Doc_15696449_1227_1238_Disease, diuretic use, and urine sediment score (>3) as risk factors.
15696449	11	1301	Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis.
15696449	12	1408	Patients who had Doc_15696449_1425_1428_Disease after high-dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often (P = 0.007), and had a worse 1-year survival (P = 0.03).
15696449	13	1542	The timing of Doc_15696449_1568_1580_Disease strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent.
15696449	14	1633	Ongoing Doc_15696449_1641_1655_Disease may be a prerequisite for Doc_15696449_1682_1694_Disease by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment.
15696449	15	1753	Development of Doc_15696449_1768_1771_Disease adversely affected the outcome after PBSCT.

15815446	2	321	Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/Doc_15815446_455_467_Disease (90/HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/Doc_15815446_569_581_Disease (15/HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of Doc_15815446_650_662_Disease and 75 min of normotension.
15815446	3	691	Part A, for eight rats in each group Doc_15815446_728_740_Disease was evaluated by staining tissue using Doc_15815446_780_815_Chemical and Doc_15815446_820_825_Disease was evaluated by microgravimetry.
15815446	4	860	Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye.
15815446	5	1025	Doc_15815446_1025_1037_Disease (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/HTN group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- SD) versus the 90/HTN group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5).
15815446	6	1225	Specific gravity was greater in the 15/HTN group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/HTN (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups.
15815446	7	1366	Doc_15815446_1366_1376_Chemical (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/HTN group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/HTN group (7.3 +/- 3.2).
15815446	8	1554	This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion, a short interval of Doc_15815446_1632_1644_Disease decreases Doc_15815446_1655_1667_Disease and Doc_15815446_1672_1677_Disease; and that sustained Doc_15815446_1698_1710_Disease increases the risk of vasogenic Doc_15815446_1743_1748_Disease.

15817013	3	391	A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals.
15817013	4	462	Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with Doc_15817013_612_631_Disease on Doc_15817013_635_643_Chemical were enrolled.
15817013	5	659	Information regarding major Doc_15817013_701_709_Disease episodes, Doc_15817013_720_727_Disease, and Doc_15817013_733_741_Chemical use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records.
15817013	6	826	Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis.
15817013	7	948	Total follow-up on Doc_15817013_967_975_Chemical was 530 years (mean 28 months).
15817013	8	1008	There were 53 major Doc_15817013_1028_1039_Disease, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal Doc_15817013_1130_1136_Disease.

15859361	2	300	The rate of adverse Doc_15859361_320_336_Disease reactions to these agents is generally low.
15859361	3	381	On the contrary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly involved in such reactions.
15859361	4	485	Doc_15859361_485_494_Chemical (CE) is a novel drug, with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme.
15859361	5	570	We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and Doc_15859361_704_705_Chemical associated or not to classic NSAIDs.
15859361	6	743	We studied 9 patients with Doc_15859361_779_795_Disease to P and Doc_15859361_805_806_Chemical with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs.
15859361	7	863	The diagnosis of P and Doc_15859361_886_887_Chemical-induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge.
15859361	8	940	The placebo was blindly administered at the beginning of each challenge.
15859361	9	1013	After three days, a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given.
15859361	10	1098	After 2-3 days, a single dose of 200 mg was administered.
15859361	11	1156	All patients were observed for 6 hours after each challenge, and controlled again after 24 hours to exclude delayed reactions.
15859361	12	1283	The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared: erythema, rush or Doc_15859361_1381_1390_Disease-Doc_15859361_1391_1401_Disease.
15859361	13	1403	No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients (88.8%) tolerated CE.
15859361	14	1491	Only one patient developed a moderate Doc_15859361_1529_1539_Disease of the lips.
15859361	15	1553	Only one Doc_15859361_1574_1590_Disease reaction to CE was documented among 9 P and Doc_15859361_1635_1636_Chemical-highly NSAIDs intolerant patients.
15859361	16	1672	Thus, we conclude that CE is a reasonably safe alternative to be used in subjects who do not tolerate P and Doc_15859361_1780_1781_Chemical.
15882284	0	0	Case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and Doc_15882284_83_106_Disease.
15882284	1	108	Studies on the association between the long-term use of Doc_15882284_176_183_Chemical and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Doc_15882284_258_281_Disease (Doc_15882284_283_287_Disease) have given conflicting results.
15882284	2	321	In order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of Doc_15882284_403_407_Disease was carried out.
15882284	3	425	The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of Doc_15882284_509_513_Disease in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997.
15882284	4	576	They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to Doc_15882284_667_671_Disease.
15882284	5	673	Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex.
15882284	6	784	Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases.
15882284	7	966	Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis.
15882284	8	1060	Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.89-1.66).
15882284	9	1162	For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for Doc_15882284_1228_1235_Chemical, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for Doc_15882284_1258_1269_Chemical, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for Doc_15882284_1292_1303_Chemical, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for Doc_15882284_1330_1340_Chemical NSAIDs.
15882284	10	1349	The risk of Doc_15882284_1361_1365_Disease associated with Doc_15882284_1382_1389_Chemical was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular Doc_15882284_1517_1528_Disease as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)].
15882284	11	1571	Our data indicate that long-term use of Doc_15882284_1623_1633_Chemical analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of Doc_15882284_1705_1709_Disease.
15882284	12	1711	However, the chronic use of Doc_15882284_1739_1746_Chemical may increase the risk of Doc_15882284_1772_1776_Disease.

15987266	1	125	GAP43 has been thought to be linked with Doc_15987266_175_196_Disease (Doc_15987266_198_201_Disease) in various experimental models of Doc_15987266_237_245_Disease.
15987266	2	247	To investigate how GAP43 expression (GAP43-ir) correlates with Doc_15987266_310_313_Disease, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) of rats subject to Doc_15987266_465_483_Disease induced by Doc_15987266_495_506_Chemical (Pilo), previously injected or not with Doc_15987266_547_560_Chemical (Doc_15987266_562_565_Chemical), which has been shown to inhibit Doc_15987266_600_603_Disease.
15987266	3	605	Doc_15987266_614_617_Chemical was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats.
15987266	4	679	The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for Doc_15987266_739_742_Chemical.
15987266	5	744	Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry.
15987266	6	860	Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo, Doc_15987266_959_962_Chemical+Pilo, and control groups.
15987266	7	989	However, the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that Doc_15987266_1067_1070_Chemical+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the Pilo group.
15987266	8	1180	Our current finding that animals in the Doc_15987266_1233_1236_Chemical+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of Doc_15987266_1351_1354_Disease in these animals.
15987266	9	1373	The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43.

15991002	5	584	The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used to evaluate the effects of drugs on Doc_15991002_663_670_Disease.
15991002	6	672	Adult male Swiss Webster mice (25-32 g) were given Doc_15991002_732_740_Chemical (0.05-0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or saline 10 min before Doc_15991002_788_796_Chemical (70 mg/kg i.p.) or Doc_15991002_816_834_Chemical (15 and 30 mg/kg i.p.) injections.
15991002	7	870	After 15 min, mice were evaluated for their open- and closed-arm time and entries on the EPM for a 10-min session.
15991002	8	985	Locomotor activity was recorded for individual groups by using the same treatment protocol with the EPM test.
15991002	9	1095	Doc_15991002_1104_1112_Chemical (0.05-0.25 mg/kg) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test, whereas Doc_15991002_1202_1210_Chemical (70 mg/kg) and Doc_15991002_1226_1244_Chemical (30 mg/kg) produced an anxiogenic effect, apparent with decreases in open-arm time and entry.
15991002	10	1339	Doc_15991002_1339_1347_Chemical (0.25 mg/kg) pretreatment blocked the Doc_15991002_1386_1394_Chemical- but not Doc_15991002_1404_1422_Chemical-induced Doc_15991002_1431_1438_Disease.
15991002	11	1440	Administration of each drug and their combinations did not produce any effect on locomotor activity.
15991002	12	1541	Our results suggest that the antagonistic effect of Doc_15991002_1606_1614_Chemical on Doc_15991002_1618_1626_Chemical-induced Doc_15991002_1635_1642_Disease is specific to Doc_15991002_1658_1666_Chemical, instead of a non-specific anxiolytic effect.
15991002	13	1713	Thus, it may extend the current findings on the interaction between Doc_15991002_1781_1789_Chemical and Doc_15991002_1794_1802_Chemical.

16034922	3	364	To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, Doc_16034922_427_440_Disease, Doc_16034922_442_464_Disease, Doc_16034922_466_472_Disease, transient ischaemic attacks, Doc_16034922_503_516_Disease, Doc_16034922_518_535_Disease, Doc_16034922_537_551_Disease, Doc_16034922_553_571_Disease, Doc_16034922_573_592_Disease, cognitive function, Doc_16034922_614_622_Disease, Doc_16034922_624_633_Disease and quality of life.
16034922	4	655	SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases up to November 2004: the Cochrane Doc_16034922_742_761_Disease and Subfertility Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts.
16034922	5	899	Relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts were also searched.
16034922	6	974	SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT (oestrogens with or without Doc_16034922_1059_1071_Chemical) versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women.
16034922	7	1160	DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fifteen RCTs were included.
16034922	8	1218	Trials were assessed for quality and two review authors extracted data independently.
16034922	9	1304	They calculated risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes.
16034922	10	1412	Clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes.
16034922	11	1478	MAIN RESULTS: All the statistically significant results were derived from the two biggest trials.
16034922	12	1576	In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of Doc_16034922_1664_1686_Disease or coronary event (after one year's use), Doc_16034922_1729_1735_Disease (after 3 years), Doc_16034922_1753_1766_Disease (after 5 years) and Doc_16034922_1787_1806_Disease.
16034922	13	1808	Long-term Doc_16034922_1818_1827_Chemical-only HT also significantly increased the risk of Doc_16034922_1877_1883_Disease and Doc_16034922_1888_1907_Disease.
16034922	14	1909	Overall, the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of Doc_16034922_1998_2007_Disease and Doc_16034922_2012_2024_Disease with long-term use.
16034922	15	2045	Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of Doc_16034922_2188_2196_Disease.
16034922	16	2198	Among women with Doc_16034922_2215_2237_Disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of Doc_16034922_2315_2337_Disease.
16034922	17	2339	No trials focussed specifically on younger women.
16034922	18	2389	However, one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year-old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking Doc_16034922_2524_2533_Chemical-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups.
16034922	19	2580	The only significantly increased risk reported was for Doc_16034922_2635_2657_Disease in women taking combined continuous HT; their absolute risk remained very low.
16034922	20	2737	AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.
16034922	21	2826	We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control, though short-term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women.

16083708	1	114	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Progress in the understanding of susceptibility factors to Doc_16083708_192_217_Disease (Doc_16083708_219_223_Disease) and outcome predictability are hampered by the lack of systematic programs to detect bona fide cases.
16083708	2	327	A cooperative network was created in 1994 in Spain to identify all suspicions of Doc_16083708_417_421_Disease following a prospective structured report form.
16083708	3	470	The Doc_16083708_474_486_Disease was characterized according to hepatocellular, cholestatic, and mixed laboratory criteria and to histologic criteria when available.
16083708	4	620	Further evaluation of causality assessment was centrally performed.
16083708	5	688	Since April 1994 to August 2004, 461 out of 570 submitted cases, involving 505 drugs, were deemed to be related to Doc_16083708_812_816_Disease.
16083708	6	818	The antiinfective group of drugs was the more frequently incriminated, Doc_16083708_889_900_Chemical-Doc_16083708_901_912_Chemical accounting for the 12.8% of the whole series.
16083708	7	959	The hepatocellular pattern of damage was the most common (58%), was inversely correlated with age (P < .0001), and had the worst outcome (Cox regression, P < .034).
16083708	8	1124	Indeed, the incidence of liver transplantation and Doc_16083708_1175_1180_Disease in this group was 11.7% if patients had Doc_16083708_1221_1229_Disease at presentation, whereas the corresponding figure was 3.8% in nonjaundiced patients (P < .04).
16083708	9	1325	Factors associated with the development of Doc_16083708_1368_1393_Disease were female sex (OR = 25; 95% CI: 4.1-151; P < .0001), Doc_16083708_1449_1470_Disease (OR = 7.9; 95% CI: 1.6-37; P < .009), and higher baseline plasma Doc_16083708_1536_1545_Chemical value (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.22; P < .0001).
16083708	10	1595	Patients with drug-induced hepatocellular Doc_16083708_1650_1658_Disease have 11.7% chance of progressing to Doc_16083708_1695_1700_Disease or transplantation.

16565833	2	304	Doc_16565833_304_307_Chemical-induced Doc_16565833_316_330_Disease presumably results from the formation of free radicals by Doc_16565833_389_392_Chemical.

16565833	5	722	Because of the relatively short final half-life of Doc_16565833_773_780_Chemical (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between Doc_16565833_843_850_Chemical and Doc_16565833_855_858_Chemical might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of Doc_16565833_915_922_Chemical.

16565833	10	1451	Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with Doc_16565833_1503_1506_Chemical alone induced significant Doc_16565833_1533_1547_Disease in comparison to the saline control group (P<0.001).
16565833	11	1601	The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% CI 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with Doc_16565833_1706_1709_Chemical alone than that in animals of the control group.
16565833	12	1759	The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with Doc_16565833_1817_1820_Chemical preceded by Doc_16565833_1833_1840_Chemical and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019).
16565833	13	1939	The mean protective effect by adding Doc_16565833_1976_1983_Chemical before Doc_16565833_1991_1994_Chemical led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes.
16565833	14	2089	This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between Doc_16565833_2156_2163_Chemical and Doc_16565833_2168_2171_Chemical administration (P=0.345).

16723784	3	338	METHODS AND RESULTS: Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated.
16723784	4	437	Bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 Doc_16723784_520_522_Disease and 81 Doc_16723784_530_533_Disease cases.
16723784	5	541	Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (LAD) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively.
16723784	6	651	Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months.
16723784	7	743	There was marked Doc_16723784_760_775_Disease greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, Doc_16723784_812_823_Disease less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each.

16731636	1	102	We have previously shown that a permanent Doc_16731636_144_154_Disease in the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rate.
16731636	2	269	In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist Doc_16731636_406_419_Chemical (Iso).
16731636	3	427	Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used.
16731636	4	491	In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.
16731636	5	677	Doc_16731636_677_691_Disease induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively).
16731636	6	842	The greater Doc_16731636_854_868_Disease in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats.
16731636	7	1027	The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist Doc_16731636_1097_1107_Chemical in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by Doc_16731636_1270_1278_Chemical on HR was similar in both strains.
16731636	8	1314	These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and Doc_16731636_1423_1434_Disease, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.

16801510	9	1282	QTc length was weakly but significantly associated with Doc_16801510_1338_1347_Chemical daily dose (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, 0.20; P<.01).
16801510	10	1413	Multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8% of QTc variability to Doc_16801510_1497_1506_Chemical dose, cytochrome P-450 3A4 drug-drug interactions, Doc_16801510_1558_1569_Disease, and altered liver function.
16801510	11	1599	QT interval prolongation in Doc_16801510_1640_1649_Chemical maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent finding.
16801510	12	1733	Doc_16801510_1733_1742_Chemical dose, presence of cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, Doc_16801510_1794_1803_Chemical level, and liver function contribute to Doc_16801510_1844_1859_Disease.

16810074	4	479	We hypothesized that Doc_16810074_500_530_Disease (venomotor) tone plays a role in Doc_16810074_564_587_Chemical (LNNA) Doc_16810074_595_607_Disease through these mechanisms.
16810074	5	634	Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor Doc_16810074_683_687_Chemical (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks.
16810074	6	729	Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P<0.05).
16810074	7	844	Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction.
16810074	8	930	Maximal contraction to Doc_16810074_953_967_Chemical was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced (54% control).
16810074	9	1119	Maximum contraction of vena cava to Doc_16810074_1155_1169_Chemical (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed.
16810074	10	1249	Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA Doc_16810074_1347_1359_Disease at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA.

16810074	12	1605	Similarly, ganglionic blockade with Doc_16810074_1641_1654_Chemical caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA Doc_16810074_1699_1711_Disease rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg).

16867246	1	120	Doc_16867246_125_148_Disease (Doc_16867246_150_153_Disease) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor.
16867246	2	260	Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in Doc_16867246_414_427_Disease patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression.
16867246	3	526	In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in Doc_16867246_576_590_Chemical-induced Doc_16867246_599_602_Disease in Doc_16867246_606_619_Disease patients.
16867246	4	630	We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 Doc_16867246_785_798_Disease inpatients (59 with Doc_16867246_819_822_Disease and 87 without Doc_16867246_838_841_Disease according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with Doc_16867246_893_907_Chemical after 8 weeks.
16867246	5	923	The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
16867246	6	999	Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study.
16867246	7	1121	No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups.
16867246	8	1349	Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by Doc_16867246_1531_1545_Chemical, at least in Chinese patients with Doc_16867246_1581_1594_Disease.

16876986	1	98	Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for Doc_16876986_198_206_Disease are still controversial.
16876986	2	232	In order to elucidate this problem, we have studied the effect of long-term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent Doc_16876986_358_366_Disease.
16876986	3	368	Male Wistar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming pool.
16876986	4	464	Thereafter, Doc_16876986_476_484_Disease were induced by Doc_16876986_501_512_Chemical injections in trained and non-trained control groups.
16876986	5	567	During the acute period of Doc_16876986_594_612_Disease, we measured: (1) the latency of the first motor sign, (2) the intensity of Doc_16876986_689_697_Disease, (3) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period, and (4) the time when the acute period ended.
16876986	6	810	All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced Doc_16876986_974_982_Disease and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced Doc_16876986_1035_1053_Disease.

16880771	3	279	Because Doc_16880771_287_295_Chemical increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved.
16880771	4	436	We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning.
16880771	5	526	Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design.
16880771	6	723	Subjects received the tonically stimulating Doc_16880771_767_775_Chemical-receptor agonist Doc_16880771_793_802_Chemical (0.1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day.
16880771	7	869	The Doc_16880771_873_881_Chemical agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo.
16880771	8	954	This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training.
16880771	9	1036	Subjects treated with Doc_16880771_1058_1067_Chemical also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group.
16880771	10	1142	The extent of 'flattened' affect with Doc_16880771_1180_1189_Chemical was related to the degree of learning inhibition.
16880771	11	1240	These findings suggest that tonic occupation of Doc_16880771_1288_1296_Chemical receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic Doc_16880771_1351_1359_Chemical signals.
16880771	12	1369	Thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which Doc_16880771_1436_1444_Chemical enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and Doc_16880771_1499_1505_Disease patients.

16920333	2	475	We have studied the effects of oral treatment with Doc_16920333_526_549_Chemical on a whole-animal model in which partial Doc_16920333_591_599_Disease can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or Doc_16920333_677_684_Disease patterns.
16920333	3	695	In the animals treated with threshold doses of Doc_16920333_742_752_Chemical, the average number of Doc_16920333_776_784_Disease was 2.3+/-1.2, and average Doc_16920333_812_819_Disease duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before Doc_16920333_894_904_Chemical microperfusion prevented Doc_16920333_930_938_Disease in the 75% of the rats.
16920333	4	963	Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress Doc_16920333_1008_1016_Disease, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in Doc_16920333_1086_1094_Disease duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and Doc_16920333_1122_1129_Disease number (1.6+/-0.34) were found.
16920333	5	1162	No adverse effects of Doc_16920333_1184_1207_Chemical were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.
17028363	0	0	Doc_17028363_0_19_Disease associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing Doc_17028363_82_96_Chemical.
17028363	1	98	Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions.
17028363	2	255	Doc_17028363_255_266_Disease caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids.
17028363	3	370	We report a 23-year-old woman who developed Doc_17028363_414_433_Disease following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained Doc_17028363_519_532_Chemical derivatives, extracted from Rhizoma Rhei (rhubarb).
17028363	4	585	The Doc_17028363_589_601_Disease was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Doc_17028363_695_705_Chemical.
17028363	5	707	Renal pathology was that of hypocellular Doc_17028363_748_769_Disease.
17028363	6	771	Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild Doc_17028363_854_875_Disease and Doc_17028363_880_895_Disease was still evident histologically 4 months later.
17028363	7	945	Although a causal relationship between the use of an Doc_17028363_998_1011_Chemical-containing herbal agent and Doc_17028363_1040_1052_Disease remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial Doc_17028363_1112_1123_Disease should be considered in patients who present with unexplained Doc_17028363_1186_1199_Disease.

17035713	1	105	Doc_17035713_105_123_Chemical (Doc_17035713_125_128_Chemical) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent Doc_17035713_170_180_Chemical (Doc_17035713_182_185_Chemical) and putatively responsible for Doc_17035713_218_230_Disease following anti-Doc_17035713_246_251_Disease therapy with Doc_17035713_265_268_Chemical.
17035713	2	270	Depletion of Doc_17035713_283_293_Chemical (SH) groups has been reported from cell culture, animal and clinical studies.
17035713	3	372	In this work the effect of Doc_17035713_399_402_Chemical on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture (hRPTEC) was investigated.
17035713	4	480	Doc_17035713_480_488_Disease of Doc_17035713_492_495_Chemical was determined by protein content, cell number, LDH release, Doc_17035713_557_568_Chemical exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity.
17035713	5	609	Free Doc_17035713_614_620_Chemical were measured by the method of Ellman.
17035713	6	660	Doc_17035713_660_663_Chemical reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein, induced a loss in free intracellular Doc_17035713_741_747_Chemical and an increase in Doc_17035713_767_775_Disease markers.
17035713	7	785	Doc_17035713_785_788_Chemical but not Doc_17035713_797_805_Chemical inhibited the Doc_17035713_820_828_Chemical proteases caspase-3, caspase-8 and cathepsin B. Caspase activation by Doc_17035713_899_908_Chemical was inhibited by Doc_17035713_926_929_Chemical.
17035713	8	931	In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, Doc_17035713_991_994_Chemical induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage.
17035713	9	1056	The effects of Doc_17035713_1071_1074_Chemical on Doc_17035713_1078_1086_Chemical protease activities and Doc_17035713_1111_1117_Chemical could be reproduced in cell lysate.
17035713	10	1154	Acidification, which slowed the reaction of Doc_17035713_1198_1201_Chemical with Doc_17035713_1207_1212_Chemical donors, could also attenuate effects of Doc_17035713_1253_1256_Chemical on Doc_17035713_1260_1268_Disease markers, Doc_17035713_1278_1283_Chemical depletion and Doc_17035713_1298_1306_Chemical protease inhibition in living cells.
17035713	11	1344	Thus, Doc_17035713_1350_1353_Chemical directly reacts with cellular protein and non-protein Doc_17035713_1408_1414_Chemical, mediating its Doc_17035713_1430_1438_Disease on hRPTEC.
17035713	12	1450	This effect can be reduced by acidification.
17035713	13	1495	Therefore, urinary acidification could be an option to prevent Doc_17035713_1558_1561_Chemical Doc_17035713_1562_1573_Disease in patients.
17042797	0	0	Stereological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after Doc_17042797_96_107_Chemical-induced Doc_17042797_116_134_Disease in the adult rat.
17042797	1	153	Following Doc_17042797_163_181_Disease in the rat, dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly, and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically, in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation.
17042797	2	356	It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous Doc_17042797_451_459_Disease that ultimately develop after Doc_17042797_490_508_Disease.
17042797	3	510	However, the population has never been quantified, so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epileptogenesis.
17042797	4	658	To quantify this population, the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after Doc_17042797_800_811_Chemical-induced Doc_17042797_820_838_Disease.
17042797	5	840	The number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for Prox-1, a granule-cell-specific marker, was estimated using the optical fractionator method.
17042797	6	980	The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after Doc_17042797_1066_1084_Disease is substantial, and stable over time.
17042797	7	1123	Interestingly, the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral Doc_17042797_1223_1231_Disease, because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral Doc_17042797_1324_1332_Disease.
17042797	8	1334	The hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the septotemporal axis, although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hilus.
17042797	9	1513	The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the Doc_17042797_1607_1618_Chemical model of Doc_17042797_1628_1650_Disease.

17346443	3	630	During the follow-up of our patient, Doc_17346443_667_680_Chemical was interrupted after the appearance of a Doc_17346443_723_743_Disease, and Doc_17346443_749_761_Chemical permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects.
17346443	4	846	In our case the therapy with Doc_17346443_875_887_Chemical represented an effective treatment for a Doc_17346443_929_945_Disease patient in which Doc_17346443_963_976_Chemical-related side effects appeared.
17346443	5	1008	The safety of the Doc_17346443_1026_1038_Chemical allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Doc_17346443_1202_1218_Disease.

17351238	2	188	The patient did not self medicate.
17351238	3	223	The patient's observations were within normal limits, he was administered Doc_17351238_297_303_Chemical via a face mask and Doc_17351238_324_343_Chemical (Doc_17351238_345_348_Chemical).
17351238	4	351	Several minutes after the Doc_17351238_377_380_Chemical the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by Doc_17351238_475_492_Chemical and a fluid challenge.
17351238	5	516	There was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to hospital.
17351238	6	608	There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature.
17351238	7	695	The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre.
17351238	8	853	Prehospital care providers who are managing any patient with a Doc_17351238_916_932_Disease that fails to recover within a reasonable time frame should consider the Bezold-Jarisch reflex as the cause and manage the patient accordingly.
1735570	0	0	Chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously Doc_1735570_65_77_Disease rats.
1735570	1	84	We studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and neurogenic tone in conscious, unrestrained spontaneously Doc_1735570_277_289_Disease rats.
1735570	2	296	The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl Doc_1735570_368_392_Chemical.
1735570	3	394	The restimulation of this area with Doc_1735570_430_454_Chemical 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response.
1735570	4	512	One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats (100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).
1735570	5	695	Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group (150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).
1735570	6	848	No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups.
1735570	7	938	The ganglionic blocker Doc_1735570_961_973_Chemical (5 mg/kg i.v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups.
1735570	8	1075	The Doc_1735570_1079_1091_Chemical-induced Doc_1735570_1100_1111_Disease was accompanied by a significant Doc_1735570_1145_1156_Disease in lesioned rats (-32 +/- 13 beats per minute) but a Doc_1735570_1210_1221_Disease in sham rats (+33 +/- 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion.
1735570	9	1283	Therefore, rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons appear to play a significant role in maintaining Doc_1735570_1381_1393_Disease in conscious spontaneously Doc_1735570_1421_1433_Disease rats.

17379047	2	363	Given the lifelong nature of Doc_17379047_392_404_Disease, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-Doc_17379047_510_522_Disease therapies.
17379047	3	534	This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of Doc_17379047_602_611_Chemical (Doc_17379047_613_616_Chemical) or Doc_17379047_621_640_Chemical (Doc_17379047_642_646_Chemical)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential Doc_17379047_716_728_Disease.
17379047	4	730	The first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial.

17379047	8	1309	Response was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg or a > or =10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline.
17379047	9	1400	Control was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg compared with baseline.
17379047	10	1463	Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry.
17379047	11	1625	A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg).
17379047	12	1811	All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (Doc_17379047_2017_2020_Chemical and Doc_17379047_2025_2029_Chemical, P < 0.001).
17379047	13	2043	Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001).
17379047	14	2194	The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with Doc_17379047_2233_2236_Chemical/Doc_17379047_2237_2241_Chemical 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo.
17379047	15	2315	The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with Doc_17379047_2369_2372_Chemical/Doc_17379047_2373_2377_Chemical 320/25 mg compared with Doc_17379047_2402_2405_Chemical/Doc_17379047_2406_2410_Chemical 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002).
17379047	16	2436	Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy.
17379047	17	2592	The incidence of Doc_17379047_2609_2620_Disease was lower with Doc_17379047_2636_2639_Chemical/Doc_17379047_2640_2644_Chemical combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with Doc_17379047_2680_2684_Chemical monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%).

17384765	0	0	Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting Doc_17384765_114_134_Disease in the absence of lead exposure.
17384765	1	168	There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels.
17384765	2	297	However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Doc_17384765_387_389_Chemical-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Doc_17384765_505_507_Chemical exposure.
17384765	3	518	The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Doc_17384765_628_630_Chemical exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Doc_17384765_720_722_Chemical poisoning.
17384765	4	734	Doc_17384765_743_745_Chemical exposure produced Doc_17384765_764_783_Disease in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Doc_17384765_897_899_Chemical-exposed children.
17384765	5	918	Succimer treatment of the Doc_17384765_944_946_Chemical-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Doc_17384765_1095_1097_Chemical exposure level and the specific functional deficit.
17384765	6	1150	In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Doc_17384765_1216_1218_Chemical produced lasting and pervasive Doc_17384765_1250_1285_Disease comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Doc_17384765_1341_1343_Chemical exposure regimen.
17384765	7	1362	These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate Doc_17384765_1481_1499_Disease due to Doc_17384765_1507_1509_Chemical exposure.
17384765	8	1520	These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Doc_17384765_1645_1647_Chemical-exposed children.
17384765	9	1666	However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Doc_17384765_1803_1805_Chemical or other heavy metals.

17445520	5	805	A total of 58.6% (n = 17) of patients with Doc_17445520_848_850_Disease, 44.4% (n = 12) of patients with Doc_17445520_884_887_Disease, 12.0% (n = 3) of patients with Doc_17445520_920_922_Disease, and 7.1% (n= 2) of control subjects had a Doc_17445520_966_971_Disease attack after the 480-mg Doc_17445520_996_1004_Chemical challenge test (chi(2)(3) = 16.22, P = .001).
17445520	6	1051	The patients with Doc_17445520_1069_1071_Disease and Doc_17445520_1076_1079_Disease were more sensitive to Doc_17445520_1103_1111_Chemical than were patients with Doc_17445520_1136_1138_Disease and healthy volunteers.
17445520	7	1163	No Doc_17445520_1166_1171_Disease attack was observed after the Doc_17445520_1202_1210_Chemical-free solution intake.
17445520	8	1233	The patients with Doc_17445520_1251_1253_Disease had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups (2-way analysis of variance, group by time interaction with Greenhouse-Geisser correction: F(3,762) = 2.85, P = .026).
17445520	9	1443	Our data suggest that there is an association between Doc_17445520_1497_1510_Disease, no matter if associated with Doc_17445520_1541_1543_Disease or Doc_17445520_1547_1550_Disease, and Doc_17445520_1556_1571_Disease to an oral Doc_17445520_1583_1591_Chemical challenge test.
17484470	0	0	Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study.
17484470	1	103	BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with Doc_17484470_203_225_Disease and Doc_17484470_230_261_Disease (Doc_17484470_263_265_Disease) since, as well as addressing the Doc_17484470_300_302_Disease, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base.
17484470	2	369	However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying Doc_17484470_469_471_Disease remain incompletely understood.
17484470	3	504	The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of Doc_17484470_570_589_Disease.
17484470	4	591	Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures.
17484470	5	708	The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy.
17484470	6	818	Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function.
17484470	7	945	Doc_17484470_945_964_Disease was induced by Doc_17484470_980_991_Chemical and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of Doc_17484470_1068_1070_Disease was confirmed by echocardiography.
17484470	8	1106	MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets.
17484470	9	1156	Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of Doc_17484470_1207_1226_Disease, and after MAP.
17484470	10	1243	MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions.
17484470	11	1353	Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively.
17484470	12	1569	Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg, p = 0.0480 and Doc_17484470_1674_1677_Chemical (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045).
17484470	13	1819	After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and Emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml).
17484470	14	1978	The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in Doc_17484470_2088_2107_Disease, even in the absence of Doc_17484470_2132_2134_Disease. However, further investigations are warranted in a model of Doc_17484470_2196_2217_Disease.

17496739	1	120	Despite popular use of Doc_17496739_143_155_Chemical, the dire Doc_17496739_166_179_Disease associated with Doc_17496739_196_208_Chemical still goes unrecognized, leading to a delay in appropriate management.
17496739	2	280	We report a 57-year-old woman with Doc_17496739_315_338_Disease receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), who developed slurred speech, Doc_17496739_429_435_Disease, bizarre behavior, progressive mental Doc_17496739_474_483_Disease, and 2 episodes of generalized Doc_17496739_515_535_Disease (GTCS) after 5 doses of Doc_17496739_560_572_Chemical/Doc_17496739_573_583_Chemical (2 g/250 mg) were given for Doc_17496739_612_626_Disease with secondary Doc_17496739_642_651_Disease.
17496739	3	653	The laboratory data revealed normal plasma electrolyte and Doc_17496739_712_719_Chemical levels but Doc_17496739_731_743_Disease.
17496739	4	745	Neurologic examinations showed Doc_17496739_776_786_Disease and bilateral Babinski sign.
17496739	5	816	Computed tomography of brain and electroencephalogram were unremarkable.
17496739	6	889	Despite the use of antiepileptic agents, another GTCS episode recurred after the sixth dose of Doc_17496739_984_996_Chemical/Doc_17496739_997_1007_Chemical.
17496739	7	1009	Brain magnetic resonance imaging did not demonstrate acute Doc_17496739_1068_1078_Disease and organic Doc_17496739_1091_1104_Disease.
17496739	8	1106	Initiation of high-flux hemodialysis rapidly reversed the neurologic symptoms within 4 hours.
17496739	9	1200	Doc_17496739_1200_1212_Chemical-induced Doc_17496739_1221_1235_Disease should be considered in any uremic patients with unexplained neurological manifestations.
17496739	10	1326	CAPD is inefficient in removing Doc_17496739_1358_1370_Chemical, whereas hemodialysis can rapidly terminate the Doc_17496739_1419_1431_Chemical-induced Doc_17496739_1440_1454_Disease.
17543491	0	0	Frequency of transient ipsilateral Doc_17543491_35_55_Disease in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.
17543491	1	126	Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers.
17543491	2	314	Doc_17543491_314_355_Disease due to local anesthetics have been described, however.
17543491	3	411	Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing Doc_17543491_493_516_Disease.
17543491	4	518	We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences.
17543491	5	642	This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia.
17543491	6	753	Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy.
17543491	7	872	Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (Doc_17543491_951_962_Chemical) and short-acting (Doc_17543491_982_992_Chemical) anesthetic.
17543491	8	1006	All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively.
17543491	9	1075	Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral Doc_17543491_1143_1163_Disease.
17543491	10	1165	It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours.
17543491	11	1206	There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary Doc_17543491_1341_1361_Disease compared with those without.
17543491	12	1391	Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral Doc_17543491_1449_1469_Disease in almost half of these patients.
17543491	13	1504	Because pre-existing Doc_17543491_1525_1534_Disease is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative Doc_17543491_1715_1734_Disease.
17543491	14	1736	In patients with preoperative contralateral Doc_17543491_1780_1800_Disease, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.

17554526	1	65	The ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social interaction.
17554526	2	168	The aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational Doc_17554526_297_304_Chemical users.
17554526	3	312	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups, comprised of 21 Doc_17554526_365_372_Chemical naive participants (CN),  30 occasional Doc_17554526_413_420_Chemical (OC), and 48 regular recreational Doc_17554526_455_462_Chemical (RC) users, were compared.
17554526	4	490	An emotional facial expression (EFE) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) was administered.
17554526	5	674	Mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were derived.
17554526	6	795	Participants were also assessed with the "Eyes task" to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised to measure psychopathology.
17554526	7	985	There were no group differences in psychopathology or "eyes task" performance, but the RC group, who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the OC group, exhibited Doc_17554526_1176_1210_Disease compared to the OC and CN groups.
17554526	8	1245	The RC group also correctly identified anger, fear, happiness, and surprise, more slowly than CN, but not OC participants.
17554526	9	1368	The OC group was slower than CN when correctly identifying disgust.
17554526	10	1436	The selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the RC group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of Doc_17554526_1561_1568_Chemical, or Doc_17554526_1573_1580_Chemical, because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impaired.
17554526	11	1677	Possible parallels between RC users and Doc_17554526_1717_1728_Disease with respect to Doc_17554526_1745_1770_Disease, Doc_17554526_1772_1792_Disease, and etiology are discussed.

1756784	1	183	The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of Doc_1756784_252_269_Disease activity.
1756784	2	280	Additionally, in models of prolonged Doc_1756784_317_335_Disease the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR.
1756784	3	518	In this study, Doc_1756784_533_551_Disease was induced by systemic injection of Doc_1756784_589_600_Chemical in rats.
1756784	4	610	The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes.
1756784	5	771	Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of Doc_1756784_860_878_Disease were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR.
1756784	6	963	Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific Doc_1756784_1021_1028_Chemical-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect Doc_1756784_1076_1091_Disease in SNR.
1756784	7	1100	Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and against the glial Doc_1756784_1226_1233_Chemical-binding protein, S-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes.
1756784	8	1312	Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic Doc_1756784_1468_1473_Disease formation.
1756784	9	1485	Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of Doc_1756784_1583_1591_Disease in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects.
1756784	10	1681	At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining.
1756784	11	1748	By 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating Doc_1756784_1819_1834_Disease, and Nissl-staining visualized some Doc_1756784_1871_1890_Disease.
1756784	12	1892	Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours.
1756784	13	1997	By 6 h, vasogenic Doc_1756784_2015_2020_Disease covered the lesioned SNR.
1756784	14	2047	By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR.
1756784	15	2132	By 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area.
1756784	16	2258	In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR.
1756784	17	2390	Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus.
1756784	18	2464	Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR.
1756784	19	2662	Both cell elements may suffer in common from Doc_1756784_2707_2728_Disease and Doc_1756784_2733_2761_Disease as occur during massive Doc_1756784_2786_2804_Disease.

17572393	5	784	Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of Doc_17572393_890_905_Chemical and Doc_17572393_910_920_Chemical dismutase were determined.
17572393	6	948	Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in Doc_17572393_1117_1121_Chemical-exposed Doc_17572393_1130_1148_Disease group.
17572393	7	1156	There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in Doc_17572393_1251_1255_Chemical-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and Doc_17572393_1442_1451_Chemical significantly reversed these changes.
17572393	8	1490	Doc_17572393_1490_1505_Chemical level in Doc_17572393_1515_1519_Chemical-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and Doc_17572393_1578_1587_Chemical decreased Doc_17572393_1598_1613_Chemical levels in Doc_17572393_1624_1628_Chemical group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the Doc_17572393_1696_1706_Chemical dismutase levels between these groups.
17572393	9	1746	These data suggest that exposure of animals to Doc_17572393_1793_1797_Chemical during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and Doc_17572393_1871_1880_Chemical protects the cerebellum against the effects of Doc_17572393_1928_1932_Chemical.

18422462	4	828	Clinically significant Doc_18422462_851_857_Disease (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and Doc_18422462_940_949_Disease (clinical Doc_18422462_960_968_Disease with Doc_18422462_974_981_Chemical aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL).
18422462	5	1078	Women were significantly more likely to experience Doc_18422462_1129_1144_Disease, while men were significantly more likely to experience Doc_18422462_1201_1231_Disease (p < 0.05).
18422462	6	1244	Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, Doc_18422462_1289_1292_Chemical therapy was significantly associated with developing Doc_18422462_1346_1350_Disease and Doc_18422462_1355_1358_Chemical therapy with developing Doc_18422462_1383_1404_Disease (p < 0.05).
18422462	7	1417	Doc_18422462_1417_1423_Disease and Doc_18422462_1428_1437_Disease often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART.

18450790	1	67	Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of Doc_18450790_124_149_Disease in patients treated with different doses of Doc_18450790_194_205_Chemical.
18450790	2	207	The study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude in patients with refractory Doc_18450790_335_364_Disease (Doc_18450790_366_369_Disease) treated with Doc_18450790_384_395_Chemical and use these findings to identify the Doc_18450790_435_445_Disease potential of Doc_18450790_459_470_Chemical and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment.
18450790	3	551	PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with Doc_18450790_639_642_Disease during treatment with Doc_18450790_665_676_Chemical and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed.
18450790	4	747	Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy.
18450790	5	837	During treatment, 11 patients showed a Doc_18450790_885_923_Disease compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%).
18450790	6	995	One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude.
18450790	7	1043	Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps.
18450790	8	1100	After Doc_18450790_1106_1117_Chemical treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients.
18450790	9	1174	At detection of Doc_18450790_1190_1228_Disease, the median Doc_18450790_1241_1252_Chemical cumulative dose was 21.4 g.
18450790	10	1281	The threshold Doc_18450790_1295_1312_Disease is lower than previously reported.
18450790	11	1348	Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres.
18450790	12	1480	This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical Doc_18450790_1555_1565_Disease potential of Doc_18450790_1579_1590_Chemical but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.

1858969	2	218	Two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequelae.
1858969	3	285	The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i.e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti-allergic treatment.
1858969	4	571	This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions.
1858969	5	662	It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load.
1858969	6	759	The relationship between the occurrence of Doc_1858969_802_814_Disease and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident.

18801087	3	474	The lung mass was highly suspected to be Doc_18801087_515_526_Disease on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an Doc_18801087_784_794_Chemical-related lesion.
18801087	4	811	In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed Doc_18801087_865_876_Chemical deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass.
18801087	5	1008	In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like.

19392810	4	289	A 33-year-old man presented with Doc_19392810_331_345_Disease and cerebral Doc_19392810_359_374_Disease after intravenous Doc_19392810_393_399_Chemical.
19392810	5	401	He had used Doc_19392810_413_419_Chemical since age 20, and had used 150 mg Doc_19392810_454_463_Chemical daily for 6 months.
19392810	6	484	He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital.
19392810	7	551	In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml.
19392810	8	595	In the ICU, we found Doc_19392810_616_630_Disease, Doc_19392810_632_651_Disease and Doc_19392810_656_681_Disease.
19392810	9	683	After transfer to an internal ward, we noted Doc_19392810_728_735_Disease and weakness of his left limbs.
19392810	10	768	After MRI, we found cerebral Doc_19392810_797_816_Disease.

19419794	2	340	A lesion induced by Doc_19419794_360_366_Chemical produced more severe motor deterioration in CB1 KO mice accompanied by more loss of DA neurons and increased PENK gene expression in the CPu.
19419794	3	509	Oxidative/nitrosative and neuroinflammatory parameters were estimated in the CPu and cingulate cortex (Cg).
19419794	4	617	CB1 KO mice exhibited higher Doc_19419794_646_649_Chemical levels and iNOS protein expression in the CPu and Doc_19419794_700_702_Chemical compared to WT mice.
19419794	5	724	Treatment with Doc_19419794_739_757_Chemical (12 weeks) resulted in less severe Doc_19419794_793_804_Disease in CB1 KO than in WT mice.
19419794	6	832	The results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid CB1 receptors increased the severity of Doc_19419794_922_938_Disease and DA lesion, and reduced Doc_19419794_966_972_Chemical-induced Doc_19419794_981_992_Disease.
19419794	7	994	These results suggest that activation of CB1 receptors offers neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion and the development of Doc_19419794_1123_1129_Chemical-induced Doc_19419794_1138_1149_Disease.

1943082	1	80	Reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute Doc_1943082_131_148_Disease characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver.
1943082	2	285	The pathophysiology underlying this acute Doc_1943082_327_341_Disease is unknown.
1943082	3	354	This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the Doc_1943082_434_448_Disease and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo.
1943082	4	552	Rats were subjected to a standardized Doc_1943082_590_628_Disease.
1943082	5	630	Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and Doc_1943082_706_725_Chemical.
1943082	6	727	There was no change in hepatic tissue total Doc_1943082_771_782_Chemical following Doc_1943082_793_831_Disease.
1943082	7	833	Oxidized Doc_1943082_842_853_Chemical (Doc_1943082_855_859_Chemical) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion.
1943082	8	925	There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury.
1943082	9	1021	An increase in Doc_1943082_1036_1040_Chemical within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress.
1943082	10	1148	The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes.
1943082	11	1342	These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue Doc_1943082_1397_1401_Chemical may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.

19447152	3	380	Herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of Doc_19447152_480_487_Chemical in rats.
19447152	4	497	To achieve this aim, the effects of Doc_19447152_533_540_Chemical injection immediately after and 7 days following a single Doc_19447152_599_602_Chemical administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)M) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test.
19447152	5	714	Additionally, Doc_19447152_728_747_Chemical reactive substances (TBARSs) and Doc_19447152_781_791_Chemical production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala.
19447152	6	909	Our findings demonstrated that Doc_19447152_940_947_Chemical at 10(-2) and 10(-3)M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection.
19447152	7	1077	In addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and Doc_19447152_1211_1221_Chemical generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala.
19447152	8	1312	In conclusion, Doc_19447152_1327_1334_Chemical-induced Doc_19447152_1343_1348_Disease-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in Doc_19447152_1462_1478_Disease.

20192893	2	269	To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing Doc_20192893_359_363_Chemical with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
20192893	3	441	MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with Doc_20192893_512_516_Chemical (Doc_20192893_518_522_Chemical group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal Doc_20192893_571_581_Chemical 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal Doc_20192893_704_714_Chemical (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age.
20192893	4	767	In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum Doc_20192893_810_820_Chemical was measured.
20192893	5	835	Postprocedural Doc_20192893_859_869_Chemical level decreased nonsignificantly in the Doc_20192893_910_914_Chemical group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02).
20192893	6	1049	Changes in serum Doc_20192893_1066_1076_Chemical after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the Doc_20192893_1152_1156_Chemical and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014).
20192893	7	1211	This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered.

2021990	1	81	Doc_2021990_81_91_Chemical, a Doc_2021990_95_104_Chemical 2 (H2) antagonist, produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation, especially in critically ill patients.
2021990	2	227	This may be because Doc_2021990_247_257_Chemical acts as a Doc_2021990_268_277_Chemical agonist.
2021990	3	287	We, therefore, investigated the effects of the Doc_2021990_334_343_Chemical 1(H1) receptor antagonist, Doc_2021990_371_386_Chemical, on the haemodynamic changes observed after Doc_2021990_431_441_Chemical in ICU patients.
2021990	4	459	Each patient was studied on two separate days.
2021990	5	506	In a random fashion, they received Doc_2021990_541_551_Chemical 200 mg iv on one day, and on the other, a pretreatment of Doc_2021990_610_625_Chemical 40 mg iv with Doc_2021990_640_650_Chemical 200 mg iv.
2021990	6	662	In the non-pretreatment group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased from 107.4 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 86.7 +/- 11.4 mmHg (P less than 0.01) two minutes after Doc_2021990_815_825_Chemical.
2021990	7	827	Also, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased during the eight-minute observation period (P less than 0.01).
2021990	8	941	In contrast, in the pretreatment group, little haemodynamic change was seen.
2021990	9	1018	We conclude that an H1 antagonist may be useful in preventing Doc_2021990_1080_1091_Disease caused by iv Doc_2021990_1105_1115_Chemical, since the vasodilating activity of Doc_2021990_1152_1162_Chemical is mediated, in part, through the H1 receptor.

20495512	6	753	Early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment, as its delay may result in catastrophic outcomes.
20495512	7	921	The treatment of Doc_20495512_938_941_Disease mandates an immediate cessation of all Doc_20495512_981_988_Chemical exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy, most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor.
20495512	8	1097	Current "diagnostic" tests, which primarily include functional and antigenic assays, have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of Doc_20495512_1252_1255_Disease.

20682692	7	1418	Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice.
20682692	8	1544	Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in Doc_20682692_1663_1666_Chemical-induced Doc_20682692_1675_1695_Disease.
20682692	9	1697	Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, Doc_20682692_1784_1806_Disease, and retarded progression of Doc_20682692_1836_1847_Disease.

20828385	5	674	Comparison of the two biopsies showed that Doc_20828385_717_729_Chemical inhibited Doc_20828385_740_745_Disease cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic Doc_20828385_849_854_Disease cells.
20828385	6	862	Apart from this cytostatic effect, Doc_20828385_897_909_Chemical had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of Doc_20828385_956_961_Disease microvessel density and of VEGF expression.
20828385	7	1006	Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-Doc_20828385_1083_1091_Disease tissue repair, were found after 6-month Doc_20828385_1132_1144_Chemical therapy.
20828385	8	1154	Thus, Doc_20828385_1160_1172_Chemical reduced Doc_20828385_1181_1186_Disease burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of Doc_20828385_1272_1284_Chemical on Doc_20828385_1288_1293_Disease tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory Doc_20828385_1368_1371_Disease resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

2131034	4	524	To our knowledge, however, Doc_2131034_551_568_Disease following administration of these three agents has not been previously described.
2131034	5	651	In spite of the fact that Doc_2131034_677_681_Chemical is a useful IT agent, its combination with Doc_2131034_725_728_Chemical, Doc_2131034_730_735_Chemical and radiotherapy could cause severe Doc_2131034_772_785_Disease.

2173761	1	103	The effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and Doc_2173761_183_192_Chemical (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of Doc_2173761_387_400_Chemical (0.03-10 micrograms/kg).
2173761	2	426	Doc_2173761_426_439_Chemical, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other Doc_2173761_565_606_Disease.
2173761	3	608	In contrast, cromakalim and Doc_2173761_636_645_Chemical at all doses and Doc_2173761_663_676_Chemical at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure.
2173761	4	867	Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than Doc_2173761_928_937_Chemical in increasing CxAD.

2173761	6	1189	When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by Doc_2173761_1281_1291_Chemical (10 micrograms/kg), Doc_2173761_1312_1321_Chemical (30 micrograms/kg) and Doc_2173761_1345_1358_Chemical (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively.
2173761	7	1441	Thus, whereas Doc_2173761_1455_1468_Chemical preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and Doc_2173761_1555_1571_Chemical both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand.
2173761	8	1731	Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and Doc_2173761_1842_1851_Chemical-induced increase in CxAD.

23535177	1	131	The plasticity of primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with Doc_23535177_192_211_Disease (Doc_23535177_213_215_Disease) and Doc_23535177_221_229_Chemical-induced dyskinesias (Doc_23535177_251_255_Disease) is severely impaired.
23535177	2	279	We recently reported in young healthy subjects that inhibitory cerebellar stimulation enhanced the sensorimotor plasticity of M1 that was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS).
23535177	3	466	This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with Doc_23535177_556_560_Disease could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation.
23535177	4	669	This was evident only when a sensory component was involved in the induction of plasticity, indicating that cerebellar sensory processing function is involved in the resurgence of M1 plasticity.
23535177	5	864	The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on Doc_23535177_916_920_Disease is known.
23535177	6	931	To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1, we conducted an additional study looking at changes in Doc_23535177_1081_1085_Disease and PAS-induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral, real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation.
23535177	7	1212	Only real and not sham stimulation had an antidyskinetic effect and it was paralleled by a resurgence in the sensorimotor plasticity of M1.
23535177	8	1352	These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function, occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it, may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of Doc_23535177_1612_1642_Disease.

2358093	2	241	We therefore investigated the long-term safety of Doc_2358093_291_298_Chemical by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with Doc_2358093_369_390_Disease treated with Doc_2358093_404_411_Chemical for a continuous period of 6 months or longer.
2358093	3	459	The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 59.7 months.
2358093	4	553	Virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse reactions.
2358093	5	619	Doc_2358093_619_642_Disease (79%), Doc_2358093_650_661_Disease (60%), muscle cramps/Doc_2358093_683_691_Disease (40%), and transaminase elevations (40%) were the most common adverse reactions.
2358093	6	773	The drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patients.
2358093	7	839	No patient has died or suffered any apparent long-term sequelae that were directly attributable to the drug.
2358093	8	948	We conclude that, despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions, Doc_2358093_1024_1031_Chemical has proven to be remarkably safe over the long-term in this group of patients.

2383364	3	410	This study compared various concentrations of Doc_2383364_456_459_Chemical to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy.
2383364	4	564	Twenty-nine burn patients, each with Doc_2383364_601_618_Disease which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period.
2383364	5	735	One burn site was treated with each of four different Doc_2383364_789_792_Chemical concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent Doc_2383364_873_893_Chemical (Doc_2383364_895_899_Chemical) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds.
2383364	6	985	The other site was always treated with Doc_2383364_1024_1028_Chemical cream.
2383364	7	1036	There was a direct relationship between Doc_2383364_1076_1079_Chemical concentration and patients' ratings of Doc_2383364_1119_1123_Disease on an analogue scale.
2383364	8	1146	The 0.25 per cent Doc_2383364_1164_1167_Chemical cream was closest to Doc_2383364_1189_1193_Chemical in Doc_2383364_1197_1201_Disease tolerance; however, none of the treatments differed statistically from Doc_2383364_1273_1277_Chemical or from each other.
2383364	9	1298	In addition, ease of application of Doc_2383364_1334_1337_Chemical creams was less satisfactory than that of Doc_2383364_1380_1384_Chemical.
2383364	10	1386	It was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent Doc_2383364_1446_1449_Chemical may prove acceptable for wound care, but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use.

2400986	2	230	We report here a retrospective study of 123 children (median age, 6.5 years) receiving high-dose Doc_2400986_327_335_Chemical in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid Doc_2400986_416_422_Disease, Doc_2400986_424_436_Disease excluded.
2400986	3	447	Doc_2400986_447_455_Chemical was given p.o., every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 days.
2400986	4	512	Two total doses were consecutively used: 16 mg/kg, then 600 mg/m2.
2400986	5	579	The dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients (16 to 28 mg/kg).
2400986	6	717	Ninety-six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis; 7 (7.5%) developed Doc_2400986_799_807_Disease during the 4 days of the Doc_2400986_833_841_Chemical course or within 24 h after the last dosing.
2400986	7	887	When the total Doc_2400986_902_910_Chemical dose was taken into account, there was a significant difference in terms of Doc_2400986_987_1000_Disease incidence among patients under 16 mg/kg (1 of 57, 1.7%) and patients under 600 mg/m2 (6 of 39, 15.4%) (P less than 0.02).
2400986	8	1123	Twenty-seven patients were given a 600-mg/m2 Doc_2400986_1168_1176_Chemical total dose with continuous i.v. infusion of Doc_2400986_1221_1231_Chemical; none had any neurological symptoms.
2400986	9	1269	Doc_2400986_1269_1277_Chemical levels were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without Doc_2400986_1408_1438_Disease under 600 mg/m2 Doc_2400986_1455_1463_Chemical with Doc_2400986_1469_1479_Chemical:Doc_2400986_1480_1488_Chemical cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio was 1.39.

2400986	11	1702	This study shows that Doc_2400986_1724_1732_Chemical Doc_2400986_1733_1746_Disease is dose-dependent in children and efficiently prevented by Doc_2400986_1806_1816_Chemical.
2400986	12	1818	A Doc_2400986_1820_1828_Chemical dose calculated on the basis of body surface area, resulting in higher doses in young children, was followed by Doc_2400986_1941_1964_Disease, close to Doc_2400986_1975_1988_Disease incidence observed in adults.
2400986	13	2019	Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster Doc_2400986_2072_2080_Chemical clearance in children than in adults, this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg/kg total dose, with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects.
2400986	14	2311	The Doc_2400986_2315_2323_Chemical dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be reconsidered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies.

24234943	4	367	The serum Doc_24234943_377_383_Chemical at this time was 120 mmol/L, serum osmolality was 263 mosmol/kg, urine osmolality 410 mosmol/kg and urine Doc_24234943_490_496_Chemical 63 mmol/L, consistent with a diagnosis of Doc_24234943_539_544_Disease.
24234943	5	546	Doc_24234943_546_560_Chemical was ceased and fluid restriction implemented.
24234943	6	607	After 4 days the Doc_24234943_624_630_Chemical increased to 128 mmol/L and fluid restriction was relaxed.
24234943	7	690	During her further 3 weeks inpatient admission the serum Doc_24234943_747_753_Chemical ranged from 134 to 137 mmol/L during treatment with Doc_24234943_806_817_Chemical.
24234943	8	819	Doc_24234943_831_836_Disease has been widely reported with a range of antidepressants.

24275640	2	179	Wistar rats (n = 66) received Doc_24275640_209_212_Chemical injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of Doc_24275640_388_391_Chemical (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the Doc_24275640_431_434_Chemical acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of Doc_24275640_495_498_Chemical (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (M0) and 1 week after each injection (M1, M2, M3, and M4) to determine the chronological effects.
24275640	3	667	Animals used at M0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study.
24275640	4	741	Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point.
24275640	5	859	Single dose of Doc_24275640_874_877_Chemical was associated with increased Doc_24275640_908_930_Disease, Doc_24275640_932_940_Disease, and DNA damage (strand breaks (SBs) and Doc_24275640_982_1002_Chemical) and decreased TAP.
24275640	6	1023	The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (R = -0.99, p = 0.011), Doc_24275640_1124_1132_Disease (R = 1.00, p = 0.004), Doc_24275640_1156_1159_Chemical (R = 0.95, p = 0.049), and DNA SBs (R = -0.95, p = 0.049).
24275640	7	1219	DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP (R = -0.98, p = 0.018), and Doc_24275640_1297_1305_Disease (R = -0.97, p = 0.027).
24275640	8	1330	Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute Doc_24275640_1397_1411_Disease induced by a single dose of Doc_24275640_1440_1443_Chemical only.
24275640	9	1450	Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of Doc_24275640_1533_1536_Chemical.
24275640	10	1538	Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute Doc_24275640_1590_1598_Disease versus chronic Doc_24275640_1614_1622_Disease.

24283660	2	232	The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively.
24283660	3	389	Patients were divided into Doc_24283660_416_424_Disease group and a non-Doc_24283660_441_449_Disease group.
24283660	4	457	Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected.
24283660	5	529	Doc_24283660_529_537_Disease occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%.
24283660	6	588	All exhibited generalized Doc_24283660_614_635_Disease within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with Doc_24283660_735_743_Disease after pediatric LT included gender, pediatric end-stage Doc_24283660_800_813_Disease score before surgery, Child-Pugh score before surgery, serum total Doc_24283660_881_890_Chemical after surgery, and trough Doc_24283660_917_920_Chemical level.
24283660	7	928	Multivariate analysis showed that trough Doc_24283660_969_972_Chemical level was the only independent risk factor associated with the Doc_24283660_1036_1044_Disease.
24283660	8	1046	All children who experienced Doc_24283660_1075_1083_Disease survived with good graft function and remained Doc_24283660_1131_1138_Disease-free without anti-Doc_24283660_1157_1166_Disease drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months.
24283660	9	1225	High trough Doc_24283660_1237_1240_Chemical level was the predominant factor that contributed to Doc_24283660_1294_1302_Disease in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for Doc_24283660_1472_1475_Chemical-related Doc_24283660_1484_1492_Disease.
24284476	0	0	The flavonoid Doc_24284476_14_22_Chemical delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats.
24284476	1	84	The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid Doc_24284476_160_168_Chemical (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats.
24284476	2	344	There were no differences between saline- and Doc_24284476_390_398_Chemical-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial.
24284476	3	443	Furthermore, Doc_24284476_456_464_Chemical did not prevent the Doc_24284476_485_492_Disease induced by Doc_24284476_504_515_Chemical (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition).
24284476	4	563	The saline- and Doc_24284476_579_587_Chemical-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks.
24284476	5	729	In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete Doc_24284476_859_870_Disease was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task.
24284476	6	945	At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with Doc_24284476_1016_1024_Chemical still did not step through.
24284476	7	1053	These data suggest that 1) Doc_24284476_1080_1088_Chemical delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of Doc_24284476_1217_1225_Chemical on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.

2429800	2	213	H1- and H2-Doc_2429800_224_233_Chemical antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with Doc_2429800_287_301_Chemical in a randomized double-blind fashion to four groups: group 1--placebo; group 2--Doc_2429800_382_392_Chemical, 4 mg/kg, plus placebo; group 3--Doc_2429800_426_442_Chemical, 0.1 mg/kg, plus placebo; and group 4--Doc_2429800_482_492_Chemical plus Doc_2429800_498_514_Chemical.
2429800	3	516	Doc_2429800_516_525_Chemical release occurred in most patients, the highest level 2 minutes after Doc_2429800_595_609_Chemical dosing.
2429800	4	618	Group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma Doc_2429800_677_686_Chemical change and systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.58; P less than 0.05) not present in group 4.
2429800	5	780	Prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resistance.
2429800	6	872	These data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with Doc_2429800_940_954_Chemical dosing are only partially explained by Doc_2429800_994_1003_Chemical release.

24309294	2	260	We have previously reported that CCK-8 significantly alleviated Doc_24309294_324_332_Chemical-induced Doc_24309294_341_348_Disease and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in Doc_24309294_426_434_Chemical-treated animals.
24309294	3	452	Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or Doc_24309294_629_637_Chemical-treated rats.
24309294	4	652	Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region.
24309294	5	753	Acute Doc_24309294_759_767_Chemical (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by Doc_24309294_911_919_Chemical injection.
24309294	6	931	Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats.
24309294	7	1074	Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist Doc_24309294_1120_1125_Chemical,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not.
24309294	8	1241	The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of Doc_24309294_1309_1317_Chemical on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on Doc_24309294_1409_1417_Chemical-induced Doc_24309294_1426_1443_Disease.

24333387	3	401	Doc_24333387_401_404_Chemical causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation.
24333387	4	509	Doc_24333387_509_512_Chemical also significantly increased the level of ROS, Doc_24333387_560_567_Chemical, Doc_24333387_569_575_Chemical and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity.
24333387	5	700	Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in Doc_24333387_768_771_Chemical treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex.
24333387	6	846	Doc_24333387_846_849_Chemical treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post Doc_24333387_1046_1068_Disease.

24333387	9	1368	The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and Doc_24333387_1409_1416_Chemical levels were increased.
24333387	10	1440	On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Doc_24333387_1522_1528_Chemical levels remained unaffected.
24333387	11	1557	Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function.
24333387	12	1700	Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post Doc_24333387_1762_1784_Disease are the key factors in Doc_24333387_1808_1811_Chemical induced Doc_24333387_1820_1837_Disease and neuronal cell death.

24341598	3	476	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with Doc_24341598_641_651_Chemical values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL.
24341598	4	686	Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients.
24341598	5	758	The first group of patients was administered Doc_24341598_803_827_Chemical; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% Doc_24341598_885_893_Chemical and Doc_24341598_898_916_Chemical, while the third group was administered Doc_24341598_957_981_Chemical before and after the contrast injection.
24341598	6	1023	The third group received an additional injection of Doc_24341598_1075_1084_Chemical the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection.
24341598	7	1147	All of the patients' plasma blood Doc_24341598_1181_1194_Chemical (BUN) and Doc_24341598_1205_1215_Chemical levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material.
24341598	8	1326	The basal Doc_24341598_1345_1355_Chemical levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05).
24341598	9	1409	Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed Doc_24341598_1483_1502_Disease (Doc_24341598_1504_1507_Disease) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%).
24341598	10	1573	The number of patients who developed Doc_24341598_1610_1613_Disease on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05).
24341598	11	1768	There was no significant difference between Doc_24341598_1824_1848_Chemical, Doc_24341598_1850_1868_Chemical and Doc_24341598_1873_1897_Chemical with Doc_24341598_1903_1912_Chemical application in prevention of Doc_24341598_1942_1945_Disease.
24345882	0	0	Neurocognitive and neuroradiologic central nervous system late effects in children treated on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) Doc_24345882_125_130_Chemical (standard risk) and Doc_24345882_151_156_Chemical (lesser risk) Doc_24345882_171_199_Disease protocols (ACCL0131): a methotrexate consequence?
24345882	1	250	A report from the Children's Oncology Group.
24345882	2	295	Concerns about long-term Doc_24345882_320_332_Chemical (Doc_24345882_334_337_Chemical) Doc_24345882_339_352_Disease in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (IT) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic Doc_24345882_461_464_Chemical administration in children with Doc_24345882_497_525_Disease.
24345882	3	527	In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of Doc_24345882_598_617_Disease were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (Doc_24345882_808_813_Chemical).
24345882	4	816	A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with "standard-risk" Doc_24345882_906_934_Disease, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of Doc_24345882_989_1001_Disease at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from Doc_24345882_1050_1055_Chemical and 38 from P9605.
24345882	5	1075	Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment.
24345882	6	1200	Significantly more P9605 patients developed Doc_24345882_1244_1263_Disease compared with Doc_24345882_1278_1283_Chemical patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment.
24345882	7	1441	Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ.
24345882	8	1513	Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on Doc_24345882_1668_1673_Chemical (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures).
24345882	9	1720	This supports ongoing concerns about intensive Doc_24345882_1767_1770_Chemical exposure as a major contributor to CNS late effects.

24434397	1	73	We report a 45-year-old lady with chronic Doc_24434397_115_129_Disease stage 4 due to chronic Doc_24434397_153_177_Disease.
24434397	2	179	She was admitted to our center for severe Doc_24434397_221_227_Disease due to Doc_24434397_235_246_Disease and deterioration of renal function.
24434397	3	284	She was infused three units of packed cells during a session of hemodialysis.
24434397	4	362	Doc_24434397_362_377_Chemical (TNA) 1 g 8-hourly was administered to her to control Doc_24434397_432_440_Disease per vaginum.
24434397	5	454	Two hours after the sixth dose of TNA, she had an episode of generalized Doc_24434397_527_551_Disease.
24434397	6	553	TNA was discontinued.
24434397	7	575	Investigations of the patient revealed no biochemical or structural central Doc_24434397_651_679_Disease that could have provoked the Doc_24434397_709_720_Disease.
24434397	8	722	She did not require any further dialytic support.
24434397	9	772	She had no further episodes of Doc_24434397_803_813_Disease till dis-charge and during the two months of follow-up.
24434397	10	870	Thus, the precipitating cause of Doc_24434397_903_914_Disease was believed to be an Doc_24434397_937_945_Disease of TNA.

24438483	1	111	Pre-treatment with lipid emulsions has been shown to increase lethal doses of Doc_24438483_201_212_Chemical, and the lipid content of Doc_24438483_239_247_Chemical may alleviate Doc_24438483_262_273_Chemical-induced Doc_24438483_282_296_Disease.
24438483	2	298	The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Doc_24438483_353_361_Chemical in intralipid or medialipid emulsions on Doc_24438483_403_414_Chemical-induced Doc_24438483_423_437_Disease.
24438483	3	439	Rats were anaesthetised with Doc_24438483_477_485_Chemical and were given 0.5 mg/kg/min Doc_24438483_515_523_Chemical in intralipid (Group P), Doc_24438483_549_557_Chemical in medialipid (Group L), or saline (Group C) over 20 min.
24438483	4	616	Thereafter, 2 mg/kg/min Doc_24438483_640_651_Chemical 0.5% was infused.
24438483	5	670	We recorded time to first Doc_24438483_696_707_Disease occurrence, respective times to 25% and 50% reduction of the heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure, and time to Doc_24438483_825_833_Disease and total amount of Doc_24438483_854_865_Chemical consumption.
24438483	6	879	Blood and tissue samples were collected following Doc_24438483_929_937_Disease.
24438483	7	939	The time to first Doc_24438483_966_977_Disease occurrence, time to 25% and 50% reductions in HR, and time to Doc_24438483_1040_1048_Disease were longer in Group P than the other groups.
24438483	8	1095	The cumulative Doc_24438483_1110_1121_Chemical dose given at those time points was higher in Group P. Plasma Doc_24438483_1184_1195_Chemical levels were significantly lower in Group P than in Group C. Doc_24438483_1256_1267_Chemical levels in the brain and heart were significantly lower in Group P and Group L than in Group C. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pre-treatment with Doc_24438483_1411_1419_Chemical in intralipid, compared with Doc_24438483_1449_1457_Chemical in medialipid or saline, delayed the onset of Doc_24438483_1504_1515_Chemical-induced Doc_24438483_1524_1535_Disease effects as well as reduced plasma Doc_24438483_1570_1581_Chemical levels.
24438483	9	1590	Further studies are needed to explore tissue Doc_24438483_1635_1646_Chemical levels of Doc_24438483_1657_1665_Chemical in medialipid and adapt these results to clinical practice.

24451297	1	75	Although Doc_24451297_84_91_Chemical are generally well-tolerated drugs, recent cases of Doc_24451297_144_169_Disease associated with their use have been reported.
24451297	2	216	A 52-year-old Chinese man reported with Doc_24451297_256_268_Disease, which appeared 12 hours after beginning treatment with Doc_24451297_325_336_Chemical.
24451297	3	338	Patient presented with complaints of increasing Doc_24451297_386_392_Disease, Doc_24451297_394_402_Disease, and upper Doc_24451297_414_428_Disease.
24451297	4	430	His laboratory values showed elevated Doc_24451297_468_476_Chemical kinase and transaminases.
24451297	5	503	Testing for autoantibodies was also negative.
24451297	6	549	The liver biochemistries eventually normalized within 3 weeks of stopping the Doc_24451297_627_638_Chemical.
24451297	7	640	Therefore, when prescribing statins, the possibility of Doc_24451297_696_710_Disease should be taken into account.
24459006	0	0	Doc_24459006_0_11_Chemical associated Doc_24459006_23_38_Disease and Doc_24459006_43_59_Disease.
24459006	1	61	We describe a second case of Doc_24459006_96_107_Chemical associated Doc_24459006_119_134_Disease with Doc_24459006_140_156_Disease and recovery upon discontinuation of therapy.
24459006	2	203	The patient began to have changes in white blood cells and platelets within 48 h of administration of Doc_24459006_305_316_Chemical and began to recover with 48 h of discontinuation.
24459006	3	368	This case highlights that drug-induced Doc_24459006_407_423_Disease can occur unexpectedly as a result of treatment with a commonly used drug thought to be "safe".
24459006	4	520	According to Naranjo's algorithm the likelihood that our patient's Doc_24459006_599_614_Disease and Doc_24459006_619_635_Disease occurred as a result of therapy with Doc_24459006_673_684_Chemical is probable, with a total of six points.
24459006	5	726	We feel that the weight of the overall evidence of this evidence is strong.

24464946	2	376	Seventy-five patients with Doc_24464946_412_432_Disease treated with Doc_24464946_446_456_Chemical were studied.
24464946	3	471	Blood collection and echocardiography were performed at baseline, 1 day after the third cycle, and 1 day after completion of chemotherapy.
24464946	4	610	Patients were studied using echocardiography during follow-up.
24464946	5	673	Global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), and radial strain (GRS) were calculated using speckle tracking echocardiography.
24464946	6	804	Left ventricular ejection fraction was analysed by real-time 3D echocardiography.
24464946	7	886	Doc_24464946_886_900_Disease was defined as a reduction of the LVEF of >5% to <55% with symptoms of Doc_24464946_972_985_Disease or an asymptomatic reduction of the LVEF of >10% to <55%.
24464946	8	1044	Fourteen patients (18.67%) developed Doc_24464946_1090_1104_Disease after treatment.
24464946	9	1122	GLS (-18.48 + 1.72% vs. -15.96 + 1.6%), GCS (-20.93 + 2.86% vs. -19.20 + 3.21%), and GRS (39.23 + 6.44% vs. 34.98 + 6.2%) were markedly reduced and cTnT was elevated from 0.0010 + 0.0020 to 0.0073 + 0.0038 ng/mL (P all < 0.01) at the completion of chemotherapy compared with baseline values.
24464946	10	1414	A >15.9% decrease in GLS [sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 75%; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.815; P = 0.001] and a >0.004 ng/mL elevation in cTnT (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 64%; AUC = 0.757; P = 0.005) from baseline to the third cycle of chemotherapy predicted later Doc_24464946_1686_1700_Disease.
24464946	11	1702	The decrease in GLS remained the only independent predictor of Doc_24464946_1765_1779_Disease (P = 0.000).

24675088	1	122	Many efficacious Doc_24675088_139_145_Disease treatments cause significant Doc_24675088_175_192_Disease, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking.
24675088	2	308	In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive Doc_24675088_367_378_Chemical (Doc_24675088_380_383_Chemical)-induced Doc_24675088_393_407_Disease, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this Doc_24675088_636_644_Disease.
24675088	3	646	Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg Doc_24675088_694_697_Chemical weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing "recovery" period.
24675088	4	768	Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose.
24675088	5	894	Histopathological analysis revealed progressive Doc_24675088_942_968_Disease, Doc_24675088_970_981_Disease/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses.
24675088	6	1037	Extensive replacement Doc_24675088_1059_1067_Disease (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period.
24675088	7	1144	Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in "clinical" Doc_24675088_1376_1390_Disease by 12 weeks.
24675088	8	1404	Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%.
24675088	9	1583	Doc_24675088_1583_1591_Chemical I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak Doc_24675088_1645_1655_Chemical contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and Doc_24675088_1709_1730_Disease.
24675088	10	1732	In summary, subcellular Doc_24675088_1756_1782_Disease was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations.
24675088	11	1889	Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later.

24684312	1	127	Intradermal injections of Doc_24684312_153_162_Chemical and Doc_24684312_167_176_Chemical are attractive to use in human Doc_24684312_208_225_Disease models because Doc_24684312_241_253_Disease and Doc_24684312_258_267_Disease mimic isolated aspects of clinical Doc_24684312_303_317_Disease.
24684312	2	319	The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these models.
24684312	3	404	Twenty healthy male volunteers (mean age 24 years; range 18-38 years) received intradermal injections of Doc_24684312_509_518_Chemical and Doc_24684312_523_532_Chemical in the volar forearm.
24684312	4	555	Magnitudes of secondary pinprick Doc_24684312_588_600_Disease and brush-evoked Doc_24684312_618_627_Disease were investigated using von Frey filaments (gauges 10, 15, 60 and 100 g) and Doc_24684312_705_718_Disease.
24684312	5	720	Areas of secondary Doc_24684312_739_751_Disease and Doc_24684312_756_765_Disease were quantified immediately after injection and after 15, 30 and 60 min.
24684312	6	839	Two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were performed.
24684312	7	910	Reproducibility across and within volunteers (inter- and intra-individual variation, respectively) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV).
24684312	8	1104	Secondary pinprick Doc_24684312_1123_1135_Disease was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale (VAS) response to von Frey gauges 60 and 100 g (P < 0.001) after Doc_24684312_1264_1273_Chemical injection.
24684312	9	1285	For Doc_24684312_1289_1298_Chemical, secondary pinprick Doc_24684312_1319_1331_Disease was detected with all von Frey gauges (P < 0.001).
24684312	10	1383	Doc_24684312_1383_1392_Chemical evoked reproducible VAS response to all von Frey gauges (ICC > 0.60) and Doc_24684312_1466_1479_Disease (ICC > 0.83).

24691439	2	176	If untreated, these patients can develop a Doc_24691439_219_237_Disease that resembles Doc_24691439_253_280_Disease (Doc_24691439_282_286_Disease).
24691439	3	289	The underlying pathology of glucocorticoid-induced Doc_24691439_340_348_Disease is not fully understood, due in part to lack of an appropriate animal model.
24691439	4	426	Here, we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid-induced Doc_24691439_486_494_Disease that exhibits Doc_24691439_509_517_Disease features that are observed in patients.
24691439	5	558	Treatment of WT mice with topical ocular 0.1% Doc_24691439_604_617_Chemical led to elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), functional and Doc_24691439_681_716_Disease cells, and Doc_24691439_728_747_Disease, resembling glucocorticoid-induced Doc_24691439_783_791_Disease in human patients.
24691439	6	811	Furthermore, Doc_24691439_824_837_Chemical-induced Doc_24691439_846_865_Disease was associated with chronic ER stress of the trabecular meshwork (TM).
24691439	7	937	Similar to patients, withdrawal of Doc_24691439_972_985_Chemical treatment reduced elevated IOP and ER stress in this animal model.
24691439	8	1053	Doc_24691439_1053_1066_Chemical induced the transcriptional factor CHOP, a marker for chronic ER stress, in the anterior segment tissues, and Doc_24691439_1177_1190_Disease reduced ER stress in these tissues and prevented Doc_24691439_1240_1253_Chemical-induced Doc_24691439_1262_1281_Disease.
24691439	9	1283	Furthermore, reduction of ER stress in the TM with Doc_24691439_1334_1357_Chemical prevented Doc_24691439_1368_1381_Chemical-induced Doc_24691439_1390_1409_Disease in WT mice.
24691439	10	1422	Our data indicate that ER stress contributes to glucocorticoid-induced Doc_24691439_1493_1512_Disease and suggest that reducing ER stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid-induced Doc_24691439_1625_1633_Disease.

24709919	3	292	In this study, we investigated the effects of Re, Doc_24709919_342_345_Chemical, and Rb1 Doc_24709919_355_367_Chemical, the bioactive components of ginseng, on OIH.
24709919	4	414	OIH was achieved in mice after subcutaneous administration of Doc_24709919_476_484_Chemical for 7 consecutive days three times per day.
24709919	5	529	During withdrawal (days 8 and 9), these mice were administered Re, Doc_24709919_596_599_Chemical, or Rb1 intragastrically two times per day.
24709919	6	644	On the test day (day 10), mice were subjected to the thermal sensitivity test and the Doc_24709919_730_741_Chemical-induced writhing test.
24709919	7	765	Re (300 mg/kg) inhibited OIH in both the thermal sensitivity test and the Doc_24709919_839_850_Chemical-induced writhing test.
24709919	8	874	However, the Doc_24709919_887_890_Chemical and Rb1 Doc_24709919_899_911_Chemical failed to prevent OIH in either test.

24753331	5	821	Dermal exposure of rats to Doc_24753331_857_864_Chemical at 300 mg/kg produced patterns of developmental Doc_24753331_913_921_Disease similar to those resulting from oral exposure.
24753331	6	969	Doc_24753331_969_977_Disease included embryolethality, teratogenicity, and Doc_24753331_1024_1042_Disease.
24753331	7	1044	Dermal administration of Doc_24753331_1069_1076_Chemical at 800 mg/kg resulted in an increased incidence of Doc_24753331_1128_1143_Disease and Doc_24753331_1148_1173_Disease, but retarded fetal growth was not observed as it was following oral exposure to Doc_24753331_1255_1262_Chemical.

24812279	4	376	METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (Doc_24812279_508_515_Chemical) littermates received weekly Doc_24812279_545_548_Chemical injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose).
24812279	5	600	One week after the last Doc_24812279_624_627_Chemical treatment (acute stage), MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice.
24812279	6	783	Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last Doc_24812279_828_831_Chemical treatment (late stage), MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient Doc_24812279_1027_1030_Chemical-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80.
24812279	7	1160	Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to Doc_24812279_1345_1348_Chemical treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals.
24812279	8	1418	These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates Doc_24812279_1548_1551_Chemical-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery.
24812279	9	1600	Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced Doc_24812279_1754_1768_Disease long after the cessation of drug treatment.

24971338	2	388	This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of Doc_24971338_467_470_Chemical-to-Doc_24971338_474_477_Chemical conversion in a rat model.
24971338	3	505	Four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, Doc_24971338_569_572_Chemical, Doc_24971338_574_577_Chemical, and conversion (Doc_24971338_595_598_Chemical for 3 weeks followed by Doc_24971338_623_626_Chemical for 6 weeks).
24971338	4	641	Classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed.
24971338	5	751	Doc_24971338_751_764_Disease were analyzed in Doc_24971338_782_793_Chemical and Doc_24971338_798_803_Chemical, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson's trichrome stains.
24971338	6	858	Doc_24971338_858_861_Chemical-treated rats presented Doc_24971338_885_896_Disease and NGAL (serum and urinary) as the best markers of Doc_24971338_949_965_Disease.
24971338	7	967	Short Doc_24971338_973_976_Chemical treatment presented slight or even Doc_24971338_1012_1033_Disease and TGF-b, NF- kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes.
24971338	8	1125	Prolonged Doc_24971338_1135_1138_Chemical exposure aggravated Doc_24971338_1159_1171_Disease, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7, TBARs clearance, and kidney TGF-b and mTOR.
24971338	9	1311	Conversion to Doc_24971338_1325_1328_Chemical prevented Doc_24971338_1339_1342_Chemical-induced Doc_24971338_1351_1373_Disease (absent/mild grade lesions), while NGAL (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of Doc_24971338_1471_1474_Chemical replacement to Doc_24971338_1490_1493_Chemical.

24975837	1	90	Doc_24975837_90_99_Chemical treatment has been adopted in some chemotherapies; however, this drug can induce Doc_24975837_181_200_Disease due its ability to negatively affect renal function, augment serum levels of Doc_24975837_278_288_Chemical and Doc_24975837_293_297_Chemical, increase the Doc_24975837_312_334_Disease score and up-regulate cytokines (e.g., IL-1b and TNF-a).
24975837	2	392	The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process, as well as the regulation of cytokine expression, and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the Doc_24975837_566_586_Disease status.

24975837	4	746	Additionally, WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after Doc_24975837_817_826_Chemical administration.
24975837	5	843	B2 receptor-deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice, as shown by reduced Doc_24975837_941_952_Disease, better preservation of kidney function, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less Doc_24975837_1045_1067_Disease.
24975837	6	1069	Moreover, treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum Doc_24975837_1167_1177_Chemical and blood Doc_24975837_1188_1192_Chemical after Doc_24975837_1199_1208_Chemical administration.
24975837	7	1225	Thus, our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in Doc_24975837_1290_1299_Chemical-induced Doc_24975837_1308_1327_Disease by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines, thus resulting in declined renal function.

25080425	6	974	Western blot analysis showed that Doc_25080425_1008_1021_Chemical-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by Doc_25080425_1093_1100_Chemical treatment in myocardium.
25080425	7	1126	Furthermore, Doc_25080425_1139_1146_Chemical (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax.
25080425	8	1321	The protective role of Doc_25080425_1344_1351_Chemical on Doc_25080425_1355_1372_Disease was further confirmed by histopathological examination.
25080425	9	1429	In summary, our results showed that Doc_25080425_1465_1472_Chemical pretreatment attenuated Doc_25080425_1497_1510_Chemical-induced Doc_25080425_1519_1544_Disease via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.

25084821	1	83	Doc_25084821_94_104_Chemical is a Doc_25084821_110_127_Chemical derivative, similar to Doc_25084821_151_160_Chemical, which has the highest risk of causing Doc_25084821_200_216_Disease, especially Doc_25084821_229_240_Disease.
25084821	2	242	There are some case reports about this side effect of Doc_25084821_296_306_Chemical, but possible risk factors are seldom discussed and identified.
25084821	3	371	A case of a patient with Doc_25084821_396_420_Disease that developed Doc_25084821_436_447_Disease after treatment with Doc_25084821_469_479_Chemical is described here.
25084821	4	499	CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old Taiwanese widow with Doc_25084821_547_563_Disease was diagnosed with Doc_25084821_583_607_Disease at age 60.
25084821	5	619	She developed Doc_25084821_633_643_Disease after being treated with Doc_25084821_669_679_Chemical.
25084821	6	681	After Doc_25084821_687_697_Chemical was discontinued, her white blood cell count returned to normal.
25084821	7	763	Although Doc_25084821_785_796_Disease is not a common side effect of Doc_25084821_828_838_Chemical, physicians should be cautious about its presentation and associated risk factors.
25084821	8	922	Doc_25084821_922_941_Disease may be one of the possible risk factors, and concomitant fever may be a diagnostic marker for adverse reaction to Doc_25084821_1056_1066_Chemical.
25096313	0	0	Lateral antebrachial cutaneous Doc_25096313_31_41_Disease after Doc_25096313_48_55_Chemical injection at lateral epicondyle.
25096313	1	89	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous Doc_25096313_186_196_Disease (LACNP) that occurred after a Doc_25096313_227_234_Chemical injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat Doc_25096313_280_301_Disease in a 40-year-old woman.
25096313	2	326	MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40-year-old woman presented with Doc_25096313_382_401_Disease and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a Doc_25096313_487_494_Chemical injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before.
25096313	3	554	Her sensation of light touch and Doc_25096313_587_591_Disease was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area.
25096313	4	666	The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) (6.2 uV) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uV).
25096313	5	823	The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction.
25096313	6	931	She was diagnosed with right LACNP (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings.
25096313	7	1073	Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree.
25096313	8	1150	This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a Doc_25096313_1238_1245_Chemical injection for the treatment of Doc_25096313_1277_1298_Disease.
25096313	9	1300	An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.

25119790	1	177	The potential protective effect of the dietary antioxidant Doc_25119790_236_244_Chemical (120 mg/Kg/day for 6 days) against the Doc_25119790_284_296_Disease induced by maleate was evaluated.
25119790	2	331	Tubular Doc_25119790_339_350_Disease and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of Doc_25119790_410_417_Chemical (400 mg/kg) in rats.
25119790	3	439	Doc_25119790_439_446_Chemical-induced Doc_25119790_455_467_Disease included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, Doc_25119790_562_569_Chemical, Doc_25119790_571_577_Chemical, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and Doc_25119790_633_641_Chemical b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of Doc_25119790_685_698_Disease molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of Doc_25119790_782_790_Disease and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels.
25119790	4	950	Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups.
25119790	5	1086	Maleate induced cell damage and reactive Doc_25119790_1127_1133_Chemical species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture.
25119790	6	1188	In addition, maleate treatment reduced Doc_25119790_1227_1233_Chemical consumption in Doc_25119790_1249_1252_Chemical-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using Doc_25119790_1329_1335_Chemical/Doc_25119790_1336_1345_Chemical as substrate.
25119790	7	1360	The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished.
25119790	8	1429	All the above-described alterations were prevented by Doc_25119790_1483_1491_Chemical.
25119790	9	1493	It is concluded that Doc_25119790_1514_1522_Chemical is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced Doc_25119790_1568_1579_Disease and in vitro cell damage.
25119790	10	1606	The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial Doc_25119790_1716_1722_Chemical consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.
2553470	0	0	Anticonvulsant actions of Doc_2553470_26_32_Chemical on the Doc_2553470_40_47_Chemical-Doc_2553470_48_59_Chemical model of Doc_2553470_69_87_Disease in rats.
2553470	1	97	Doc_2553470_97_103_Chemical, a noncompetitive Doc_2553470_122_142_Chemical (Doc_2553470_144_148_Chemical) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two Doc_2553470_227_234_Disease models, coadministration of Doc_2553470_263_270_Chemical and Doc_2553470_275_286_Chemical and administration of a high dose of Doc_2553470_324_335_Chemical alone.
2553470	2	343	Three major results are reported.
2553470	3	377	First, pretreatment with Doc_2553470_402_408_Chemical produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the Doc_2553470_481_488_Chemical-Doc_2553470_489_500_Chemical model but not with rats treated with Doc_2553470_538_549_Chemical alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control Doc_2553470_614_622_Disease in these two models.
2553470	4	644	Second, the anticonvulsant effect of Doc_2553470_681_687_Chemical in the Doc_2553470_695_702_Chemical-Doc_2553470_703_714_Chemical model only occurred after initial periods of Doc_2553470_760_767_Disease activity.
2553470	5	778	This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that Doc_2553470_896_902_Chemical binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the Doc_2553470_972_976_Chemical receptor.
2553470	6	987	Third, although it is relatively easy to block Doc_2553470_1034_1042_Disease induced by Doc_2553470_1054_1061_Chemical and Doc_2553470_1066_1077_Chemical by administration of anticonvulsants prior to Doc_2553470_1124_1135_Chemical, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing Doc_2553470_1179_1197_Disease and block the lethality of the Doc_2553470_1229_1237_Disease.
2553470	7	1239	Administration of Doc_2553470_1257_1263_Chemical 30 or 60 min after Doc_2553470_1283_1294_Chemical, i.e., during Doc_2553470_1309_1327_Disease, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral Doc_2553470_1373_1380_Disease activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate.
2553470	8	1430	These results suggest that activation of Doc_2553470_1471_1475_Chemical receptors plays an important role in Doc_2553470_1513_1531_Disease and Doc_2553470_1536_1548_Disease in the Doc_2553470_1556_1563_Chemical-Doc_2553470_1564_1575_Chemical model.
2553470	9	1583	This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of Doc_2553470_1657_1661_Chemical and Doc_2553470_1666_1677_Chemical were synergistic, resulting in Doc_2553470_1709_1727_Disease and subsequent mortality.
256433	0	0	Continuous infusion Doc_256433_20_30_Chemical combined with Doc_256433_45_58_Chemical for Doc_256433_63_73_Disease in Doc_256433_77_83_Disease patients.
256433	1	94	The cure rate of Doc_256433_111_121_Disease in Doc_256433_125_131_Disease patients is adversely affected by Doc_256433_166_177_Disease (less than 1,000/mm3).
256433	2	201	In particular, patients with severe Doc_256433_237_248_Disease (less than 100/mm3) have shown a poor response to antibiotics.
256433	3	312	To overcome the adverse effects of Doc_256433_347_358_Disease, Doc_256433_360_370_Chemical was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent Doc_256433_435_448_Chemical.
256433	4	450	Doc_256433_450_460_Chemical was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and Doc_256433_510_523_Chemical was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours.
256433	5	570	There were 125 Doc_256433_585_595_Disease episodes in 116 Doc_256433_612_618_Disease patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
256433	6	669	The overall cure rate was 70%.
256433	7	700	Doc_256433_700_709_Disease was the most common Doc_256433_730_739_Disease and 61% of 59 episodes were cured.
256433	8	775	Gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these Doc_256433_855_865_Disease were cured.
256433	9	878	The most common pathogen was Doc_256433_907_928_Disease and this, together with Doc_256433_953_964_Disease coli and Doc_256433_974_996_Disease, accounted for 74% of all gram-negative Doc_256433_1037_1057_Disease.
256433	10	1059	Response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count, with a 62% cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe Doc_256433_1180_1191_Disease.
256433	11	1193	However, failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response.
256433	12	1290	Doc_256433_1290_1298_Disease was the major side effect recognized, and it occurred in 11% of episodes.
256433	13	1373	Major Doc_256433_1379_1387_Disease (serum Doc_256433_1395_1405_Chemical greater than 2.5 mg/dl or BUN greater than 50 mg/dl) occurred in only 2%.
256433	14	1480	Doc_256433_1480_1488_Disease was not related to duration of therapy or serum Doc_256433_1537_1547_Chemical concentration.
256433	15	1563	This antibiotic regimen showed both therapeutic efficacy and acceptable Doc_256433_1635_1649_Disease for these patients.
25907210	0	0	Incidence of solid Doc_25907210_19_26_Disease among pesticide applicators exposed to the Doc_25907210_70_85_Chemical insecticide Doc_25907210_98_106_Chemical in the Agricultural Health Study: an updated analysis.
25907210	1	162	Doc_25907210_173_181_Chemical, a common Doc_25907210_192_207_Chemical insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with Doc_25907210_278_289_Disease in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined Doc_25907210_389_397_Chemical-associated Doc_25907210_409_415_Disease risk.
25907210	2	422	We used updated Doc_25907210_438_446_Chemical exposure and Doc_25907210_460_466_Disease incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS.
25907210	3	531	Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime Doc_25907210_612_620_Chemical use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); Doc_25907210_677_683_Disease incidence was assessed through 2010(North Carolina)/2011(Iowa).
25907210	4	748	Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CI for Doc_25907210_921_927_Disease sites with >10 exposed cases for both lifetime (LT) exposure days and intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure).
25907210	5	1090	We observed elevated Doc_25907210_1120_1131_Disease risks (N=283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT (RR=1.60; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.31; Ptrend=0.02) and IW days of Doc_25907210_1254_1262_Chemical use (RR=1.41; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.04; Ptrend=0.08).
25907210	6	1312	Doc_25907210_1312_1325_Disease (N=94) risks were non-significantly elevated (RRLT days=1.77; 95% CI 0.90 to 3.51; Ptrend=0.09; RRIW days 1.37; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.92; Ptrend=0.50), as were risks for aggressive Doc_25907210_1502_1517_Disease (N=656).
25907210	7	1527	Our updated evaluation of Doc_25907210_1566_1574_Chemical provides additional evidence of an association with Doc_25907210_1627_1638_Disease risk.
25907210	8	1645	Newly identified links to Doc_25907210_1671_1684_Disease and associations with aggressive Doc_25907210_1718_1733_Disease require further evaluation.

25951420	1	125	This study describes associations of Doc_25951420_173_178_Chemical and fine particulate matter with Doc_25951420_212_231_Disease observed among farmers in North Carolina and Iowa.
25951420	2	283	We used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self-reported, doctor-diagnosed Doc_25951420_407_426_Disease.
25951420	3	428	Daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long-term exposure and link them to study participants' geocoded addresses.
25951420	4	579	We observed positive associations of Doc_25951420_625_644_Disease with Doc_25951420_650_655_Chemical (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.98) and fine particulate matter (odds ratio = 1.34; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.93) in North Carolina but not in Iowa.
25951420	5	803	The plausibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on Doc_25951420_895_914_Disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating Doc_25951420_968_998_Disease at relevant concentrations.
25951420	6	1027	Additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed.
25986755	0	0	Low functional programming of renal AT2R mediates the developmental origin of Doc_25986755_78_96_Disease in adult offspring induced by prenatal Doc_25986755_136_144_Chemical exposure.
25986755	1	155	Our previous study has indicated that prenatal Doc_25986755_214_222_Chemical exposure (PCE) could induce Doc_25986755_251_282_Disease (Doc_25986755_284_288_Disease) of offspring.
25986755	2	304	Recent research suggested that Doc_25986755_335_339_Disease is a risk factor for Doc_25986755_361_379_Disease.
25986755	3	381	However, whether PCE could induce Doc_25986755_415_433_Disease and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
25986755	4	480	This study aimed to demonstrate the induction to Doc_25986755_529_547_Disease in adult offspring by PCE and its intrauterine programming mechanisms.
25986755	5	619	A rat model of Doc_25986755_634_638_Disease was established by PCE, male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthanized.
25986755	6	745	The results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the PCE group exhibited Doc_25986755_826_844_Disease as well as interstitial Doc_25986755_869_877_Disease, accompanied by elevated levels of serum Doc_25986755_919_929_Chemical and urine protein.
25986755	7	949	Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio was increased.
25986755	8	1143	The fetal kidneys in the PCE group displayed an enlarged Bowman's space and a shrunken glomerular tuft, accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephrogenic zone/cortical zone ratio.
25986755	9	1346	Observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes, nephrin and Doc_25986755_1491_1498_Chemical, was also detected by q-PCR.
25986755	10	1528	Moreover, AT2R gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by PCE, associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/Doc_25986755_1720_1728_Chemical kinase receptor (c-Ret) signaling pathway.
25986755	11	1772	These results demonstrated that PCE could induce Doc_25986755_1821_1830_Disease of fetal kidneys as well as Doc_25986755_1859_1877_Disease of adult offspring, and the low functional programming of renal AT2R might mediate the developmental origin of adult Doc_25986755_1995_2013_Disease.
26002693	0	0	Doc_26002693_0_13_Chemical, Doc_26002693_15_18_Disease and the t(9:22) translocation: A reality check.
26002693	1	67	Epidemiological studies of Doc_26002693_106_119_Chemical have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with Doc_26002693_178_202_Disease (Doc_26002693_204_207_Disease).
26002693	2	210	Doc_26002693_210_213_Disease has a well-documented association with ionizing radiation, but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been questioned.
26002693	3	347	Ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite Doc_26002693_403_406_Disease-associated t(9:22) translocation (Doc_26002693_441_464_Disease) in appropriate cells in vitro but, thus far, chemicals have not shown this capacity.
26002693	4	551	We have proposed that Doc_26002693_573_586_Chemical metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological reports.
26002693	5	663	In order to conduct reliable testing in this regard, it is essential that a positive control for induction be available.
26002693	6	784	We have used ionizing radiation to develop such a control.

26033014	1	82	Doc_26033014_94_105_Chemical, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased Doc_26033014_233_248_Disease in female rats.
26033014	2	265	Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of Doc_26033014_312_323_Chemical have been limited.
26033014	3	343	The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997.
26033014	4	520	We evaluated Doc_26033014_533_539_Disease incidence through 2010/2011 (NC/IA) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using Doc_26033014_632_643_Chemical.
26033014	5	645	We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of Doc_26033014_717_728_Chemical use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and Doc_26033014_787_793_Disease incidence.
26033014	6	805	We saw no association between Doc_26033014_835_846_Chemical use and incidence of all Doc_26033014_872_879_Disease combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific Doc_26033014_941_948_Disease.
26033014	7	950	For Doc_26033014_954_966_Disease, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant.

26115410	1	132	Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic Doc_26115410_279_286_Chemical (iAs) in their drinking water.
26115410	2	318	Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood.
26115410	3	475	There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to Doc_26115410_659_665_Disease.
26115410	4	667	This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of Doc_26115410_773_779_Disease development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure.
26115410	5	854	Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of Doc_26115410_962_968_Disease stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects.
26115410	6	1108	Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and Doc_26115410_1183_1189_Disease development later in life.
26115410	7	1217	Future research should include animal studies that address mechanistic hypotheses and studies of human populations that integrate early-life exposure, molecular alterations, and latent disease outcomes.

2904523	5	756	Thus, "stress" levels of Doc_2904523_781_791_Chemical (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect.
2904523	6	859	These findings are strong support for the Doc_2904523_901_911_Chemical-Doc_2904523_912_924_Disease hypothesis in man.

2907577	1	79	Doc_2907577_79_88_Chemical antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of Doc_2907577_189_208_Disease (Doc_2907577_210_213_Disease).
2907577	2	216	In the present study, the effects of three Doc_2907577_259_273_Chemical with different potencies as Doc_2907577_302_311_Chemical antagonists Doc_2907577_324_344_Chemical, Doc_2907577_346_358_Chemical and Doc_2907577_363_375_Chemical, were examined in rats developing Doc_2907577_410_429_Disease after 4 daily injections of Doc_2907577_458_468_Chemical (200 mg kg-1).
2907577	3	484	Renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma Doc_2907577_535_539_Chemical and Doc_2907577_544_554_Chemical), functional (urine analysis and Doc_2907577_588_628_Chemical clearances) and morphological (degree of Doc_2907577_670_678_Disease) indices.
2907577	4	689	The various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function.
2907577	5	793	However, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (Doc_2907577_913_932_Chemical and Doc_2907577_937_941_Chemical).
2907577	6	944	The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the Doc_2907577_1004_1018_Chemical tested in the present study indicates that Doc_2907577_1062_1071_Chemical plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in Doc_2907577_1121_1131_Chemical-induced Doc_2907577_1140_1143_Disease.
2931989	0	0	Adverse ocular reactions possibly associated with Doc_2931989_50_62_Chemical.
2931989	1	64	A total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received Doc_2931989_142_154_Chemical, a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic acne.
2931989	2	217	Blepharoconjunctivitis, subjective complaints of Doc_2931989_266_274_Disease, blurred vision, contact lens intolerance, and Doc_2931989_322_337_Disease are reversible side effects.
2931989	3	367	More serious ocular adverse reactions include Doc_2931989_413_424_Disease, Doc_2931989_426_437_Disease cerebri, and white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinued.

2933998	2	102	Doc_2933998_102_112_Chemical, a new beta-2 adrenoceptor stimulant, was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial in patients with Doc_2933998_236_252_Disease.
2933998	3	254	Oral Doc_2933998_259_269_Chemical 50 micrograms b.d., Doc_2933998_290_300_Chemical 100 micrograms b.d., and Doc_2933998_326_337_Chemical 5 mg t.i.d., were compared when given randomly in 1-week treatment periods.
2933998	4	414	The best clinical effect was found with Doc_2933998_454_465_Chemical.
2933998	5	467	Both anti-Doc_2933998_477_486_Disease and tremorgenic effects of Doc_2933998_514_524_Chemical were dose-related.
2933998	6	544	Doc_2933998_544_554_Chemical appeared effective in the doses tested, and a twice daily regimen would appear to be suitable with this drug.
2974281	0	0	Subacute effects of Doc_2974281_20_31_Chemical and B 24/76 on Doc_2974281_47_60_Chemical-induced rat Doc_2974281_73_90_Disease in correlation with blood pressure.
2974281	1	127	We compared the potential beta-receptor blocker, B 24/76 i.e. 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-prop an-2-ol, which is characterized by beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulating properties with Doc_2974281_372_383_Chemical.
2974281	2	385	The studies were performed using an experimental model of Doc_2974281_443_456_Chemical-induced Doc_2974281_465_482_Disease in rats.
2974281	3	492	A correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of Doc_2974281_615_632_Disease with the two beta-receptor blockers.
2974281	4	670	Both beta-blockers influenced the development of Doc_2974281_719_730_Disease to a different, but not reproducible extent.
2974281	5	776	It was possible to suppress the increased Doc_2974281_818_827_Chemical decarboxylase activity with both beta-blockers in Doc_2974281_878_891_Disease hearts, but there was no effect on the heart mass.
2974281	6	943	Neither Doc_2974281_951_962_Chemical nor B 24/76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the Doc_2974281_1052_1065_Disease rat heart.
2974281	7	1077	Thus, the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta-receptor blockers Doc_2974281_1163_1174_Chemical and B 24/76 have the potency to prevent Doc_2974281_1215_1228_Chemical from producing Doc_2974281_1244_1261_Disease.

2983630	1	61	The effects of oral administration of Doc_2983630_99_107_Chemical (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of Doc_2983630_196_233_Chemical (Doc_2983630_235_239_Chemical) and Doc_2983630_245_253_Chemical were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for Doc_2983630_338_349_Disease with Doc_2983630_355_360_Disease attacks or Doc_2983630_372_386_Disease.
2983630	2	388	Doc_2983630_388_396_Chemical produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated Doc_2983630_455_462_Disease, nervousness, fear, Doc_2983630_483_489_Disease, palpitations, restlessness, and Doc_2983630_523_530_Disease in the patients compared with healthy subjects.
2983630	3	579	In the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma Doc_2983630_683_691_Chemical levels.
2983630	4	700	Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of Doc_2983630_776_784_Chemical were similar to those experienced during Doc_2983630_826_831_Disease attacks.
2983630	5	841	Doc_2983630_841_849_Chemical did not alter plasma Doc_2983630_871_875_Chemical levels in either the healthy subjects or patients.
2983630	6	927	Doc_2983630_927_935_Chemical increased plasma Doc_2983630_953_961_Chemical levels equally in the patient and healthy groups.
2983630	7	1012	Because Doc_2983630_1020_1028_Chemical is an Doc_2983630_1035_1044_Chemical receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some Doc_2983630_1098_1112_Disease patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving Doc_2983630_1175_1184_Chemical.
2983630	8	1186	Patients with Doc_2983630_1200_1217_Disease may benefit by avoiding Doc_2983630_1242_1250_Chemical-containing foods and beverages.

3074291	2	298	Two samples were studied: 12 patients received Doc_3074291_345_355_Chemical at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received Doc_3074291_448_460_Chemical at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration.
3074291	3	685	No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of Doc_3074291_806_816_Chemical.
3074291	4	818	No subject reported side effects of Doc_3074291_854_864_Chemical, as compared to three subjects reporting Doc_3074291_906_912_Disease, Doc_3074291_914_922_Disease and Doc_3074291_927_934_Disease after Doc_3074291_941_953_Chemical.
3074291	5	955	Doc_3074291_955_965_Chemical proves to be a valuable alternative to Doc_3074291_1005_1017_Chemical in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.

3084231	2	287	Repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in IQ, memory, naming, and other tasks commensurate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capacity.
3084231	3	498	Possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include: a direct central nervous system (CNS) toxic effect of Doc_3084231_643_656_Chemical; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug; and an indirect CNS toxic effect mediated through Doc_3084231_766_779_Chemical-induced Doc_3084231_788_802_Disease.

3088653	1	97	In a series of five experiments, the modulating role of Doc_3088653_153_161_Chemical on a Doc_3088653_167_178_Chemical-induced Doc_3088653_187_204_Disease in a passive avoidance paradigm was investigated in mice.
3088653	2	263	Doc_3088653_263_274_Chemical, but not Doc_3088653_284_302_Chemical (1 and 3 mg/kg), induced an Doc_3088653_331_338_Disease as measured by latency and duration parameters.
3088653	3	387	Doc_3088653_387_395_Chemical (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) injected prior to training attenuated the Doc_3088653_464_481_Disease with a peak of activity at 3 mg/kg.
3088653	4	518	The effect of Doc_3088653_532_540_Chemical could be antagonized with Doc_3088653_567_575_Chemical (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), demonstrating the opioid specificity of the Doc_3088653_642_650_Chemical effect.
3088653	5	659	Post-training administration of Doc_3088653_691_699_Chemical (3 mg/kg) as a single or as a split dose also attenuated the Doc_3088653_761_772_Chemical-induced Doc_3088653_781_788_Disease.
3088653	6	790	Control experiments indicated that neither an increase in Doc_3088653_848_852_Disease sensitivity (pre-training Doc_3088653_879_887_Chemical) nor an induced aversive state (post-training Doc_3088653_934_942_Chemical) appear to be responsible for the influence of Doc_3088653_990_998_Chemical on the Doc_3088653_1006_1017_Chemical-induced Doc_3088653_1026_1043_Disease.
3088653	7	1045	These results extend previous findings implicating a cholinergic-opioid interaction in memory processes.

3109094	2	349	The initial response to the primary attack by the Doc_3109094_399_415_Chemical metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane.
3109094	3	479	This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine.
3109094	4	543	Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular Doc_3109094_717_722_Disease and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane.
3109094	5	902	The morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules.
3109094	6	1350	These changes can be effectively prevented by Doc_3109094_1396_1401_Chemical.

3125850	2	340	Anaesthesia was induced with Doc_3125850_369_380_Chemical 5 mg kg-1.
3125850	3	392	The incidence and intensity of Doc_3125850_423_444_Disease caused by Doc_3125850_455_468_Chemical were significantly greater in the control than in the Doc_3125850_523_533_Chemical group.
3125850	4	541	The intragastric pressure during Doc_3125850_574_595_Disease was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm Doc_3125850_663_666_Chemical) than in the Doc_3125850_680_690_Chemical group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm Doc_3125850_719_722_Chemical).
3125850	5	725	The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of Doc_3125850_804_825_Disease (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78).
3125850	6	877	It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during Doc_3125850_951_972_Disease caused by Doc_3125850_983_996_Chemical in healthy children.

3155884	4	710	The myocardial content of Doc_3155884_736_750_Chemical was estimated in these 8 day Doc_3155884_780_788_Disease rats.
3155884	5	795	The Doc_3155884_799_813_Chemical content was significantly increased while Doc_3155884_856_867_Chemical remained unchanged.
3155884	6	888	An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this Doc_3155884_1045_1058_Chemical resistance.
3155884	7	1071	The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that Doc_3155884_1145_1159_Chemical in itself causes the Doc_3155884_1181_1184_Chemical resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial Doc_3155884_1253_1266_Chemical sensitivity in Doc_3155884_1282_1290_Disease rats.

3323259	1	96	Increasing recognition of the importance of Doc_3323259_140_147_Chemical in the pathogenesis of Doc_3323259_171_193_Disease has stimulated research into the use of Doc_3323259_234_241_Chemical channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of Doc_3323259_296_319_Disease.
3323259	2	321	The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities.
3323259	3	431	Clinical applications of Doc_3323259_456_463_Chemical channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity.
3323259	4	516	In contrast to Doc_3323259_531_540_Chemical and Doc_3323259_545_554_Chemical, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the Doc_3323259_647_670_Chemical channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue.
3323259	5	825	As the first Doc_3323259_838_853_Chemical available for use in the United States, Doc_3323259_894_904_Chemical controls Doc_3323259_914_920_Disease and Doc_3323259_925_937_Disease with minimal Doc_3323259_951_961_Disease of cardiac function.

3323599	1	84	An experimental model of Doc_3323599_109_145_Disease (Doc_3323599_147_151_Disease) was developed in rats by the combined administration of Doc_3323599_209_234_Chemical (Doc_3323599_236_240_Chemical) and Doc_3323599_246_263_Chemical (PS).
3323599	2	270	Male Sprague-Dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous PS (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days.
3323599	3	480	The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals.
3323599	4	560	The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80.
3323599	5	612	They developed Doc_3323599_627_645_Disease and Doc_3323599_650_671_Disease.
3323599	6	673	The time-course curve of Doc_3323599_698_708_Chemical clearance dropped and showed significant difference (P less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, AMNS alone, PS alone or saline injected.
3323599	7	863	Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive Doc_3323599_909_913_Disease.
3323599	8	915	The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused Doc_3323599_1015_1024_Chemical red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm.
3323599	9	1105	Therefore, it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the Doc_3323599_1175_1183_Disease of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive Doc_3323599_1243_1247_Disease in rats resulting in the Doc_3323599_1273_1296_Disease.

3339945	2	172	Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of Doc_3339945_289_302_Chemical until onset of maximal Doc_3339945_326_334_Disease which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively.
3339945	3	388	Doc_3339945_388_400_Chemical concentrations at this endpoint in serum (total) and CSF were similar but serum (free) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats.
3339945	4	555	Doc_3339945_555_567_Chemical serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats.
3339945	5	653	Fetal serum concentrations at onset of Doc_3339945_692_700_Disease in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former.
3339945	6	815	It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the Doc_3339945_886_896_Disease response to Doc_3339945_909_921_Chemical in rats.

3375885	2	333	It is likely that preexisting Doc_3375885_363_376_Disease predisposed this patient to type Doc_3375885_410_435_Disease with Doc_3375885_441_454_Chemical synthetase inhibitors.
3375885	3	478	Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, Doc_3375885_560_575_Chemical was added, correcting the Doc_3375885_602_614_Disease and allowing Doc_3375885_628_640_Chemical therapy to be continued safely.

3383127	2	280	In two patients, Doc_3383127_297_308_Disease was associated with severe Doc_3383127_336_364_Disease.
3383127	3	366	All three patients required therapy discontinuation.
3383127	4	419	Cardiac enzymes remained normal despite transient electrocardiographic (EKG) changes.
3383127	5	505	The presentation and cardiac evaluation (hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and scintigraphic) of these patients suggest new manifestations of Doc_3383127_645_649_Chemical Doc_3383127_650_664_Disease that may be influenced by Doc_3383127_691_695_Chemical.

3423103	1	119	The effects of microinjection of Doc_3423103_152_161_Chemical (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in Doc_3423103_317_325_Chemical-anesthetized rats.
3423103	2	345	Intramedullary administration of Doc_3423103_378_387_Chemical, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate.
3423103	3	501	The Doc_3423103_505_514_Chemical-induced Doc_3423103_523_534_Disease was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy.
3423103	4	608	On the other hand, the Doc_3423103_631_640_Chemical-induced Doc_3423103_649_660_Disease was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection.
3423103	5	734	Furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal Doc_3423103_783_787_Chemical nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of Doc_3423103_838_861_Chemical, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to Doc_3423103_939_948_Chemical microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats.
3423103	6	1042	The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of Doc_3423103_1130_1139_Chemical-induced Doc_3423103_1148_1159_Disease and Doc_3423103_1164_1175_Disease.
3423103	7	1177	The induced Doc_3423103_1189_1200_Disease is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity, whereas the induced Doc_3423103_1286_1297_Disease was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity.

3439580	3	216	We report the occurrence of severe Doc_3439580_251_263_Disease (blood pressure 190/160) in a 4-year-old girl with Doc_3439580_315_328_Disease who was given Doc_3439580_343_353_Chemical to control a Doc_3439580_367_384_Disease.
3439580	4	386	It was determined later that this patient's Doc_3439580_430_435_Disease was recurring at the time of her Doc_3439580_469_481_Disease episode.
3439580	5	491	Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the Doc_3439580_596_606_Chemical (when she was in florid relapse), we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her Doc_3439580_719_731_Disease.
3439580	6	733	The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive Doc_3439580_814_828_Chemical due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by Doc_3439580_886_896_Chemical.
3439580	7	898	From this experience, we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active Doc_3439580_1008_1021_Disease.

3475563	2	245	When their adverse reactions subsided, seven of these 15 patients were rechallenged with inhaled Doc_3475563_342_356_Chemical.
3475563	3	358	These included five cases who developed hoarseness and three who developed Doc_3475563_433_444_Disease.
3475563	4	446	One patient had both.
3475563	5	468	Doc_3475563_468_479_Disease did not recur, but 60% (3/5) of patients with hoarseness had recurrence.
3475563	6	553	We conclude that patients may be restarted on inhaled Doc_3475563_607_621_Chemical when clinically indicated; however, because of the high recurrence rate, patients who develop hoarseness should not be re-challenged.
3475563	7	756	Concomitant use of oral Doc_3475563_780_790_Chemical and topical Doc_3475563_803_817_Chemical may increase the risk of developing hoarseness or Doc_3475563_868_879_Disease.

3538855	1	59	The epidemiology of Doc_3538855_79_93_Chemical-induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood.
3538855	2	142	Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate Doc_3538855_200_215_Chemical cause proximal tubular damage in most patients, but rarely, if ever, cause Doc_3538855_291_324_Disease.
3538855	3	326	Clinical trials of Doc_3538855_345_360_Chemical in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing Doc_3538855_434_453_Disease during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80%.
3538855	4	535	Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy, plasma Doc_3538855_612_626_Chemical levels, Doc_3538855_635_648_Disease, advanced age, high initial estimated Doc_3538855_687_697_Chemical clearance and, possibly, female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity.

3864191	4	471	We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals.
3864191	5	548	Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with Doc_3864191_625_632_Chemical 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated.
3864191	6	676	After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and Doc_3864191_779_792_Chemical synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay.
3864191	7	839	The other kidney was examined histologically.
3864191	8	885	A marked corticomedullary gradient of Doc_3864191_923_936_Chemical synthesis was observed in all groups.
3864191	9	975	Doc_3864191_975_979_Chemical synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01).
3864191	10	1138	Doc_3864191_1138_1145_Chemical treatment reduced Doc_3864191_1164_1168_Chemical synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary Doc_3864191_1215_1219_Chemical remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05).
3864191	11	1296	Doc_3864191_1296_1306_Chemical was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without Doc_3864191_1386_1393_Chemical administration (p less than 0.05).
3864191	12	1429	The changes in renal Doc_3864191_1450_1463_Chemical synthesis were accompanied by evidence of Doc_3864191_1506_1518_Disease in Doc_3864191_1522_1529_Chemical-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of Doc_3864191_1610_1619_Disease (p less than 0.01); increased serum Doc_3864191_1656_1666_Chemical (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or Doc_3864191_1800_1807_Chemical-treated jJ).
3864191	13	1821	These results suggest that enhanced Doc_3864191_1857_1870_Chemical synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of Doc_3864191_1978_1991_Chemical synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.

3925479	6	754	These findings suggest the hypothesis that the Doc_3925479_801_810_Disease that is produced by neuroleptics such as Doc_3925479_852_863_Chemical is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic systems.

3975902	2	305	Analysis of in vivo Doc_3975902_325_348_Disease, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant Doc_3975902_435_441_Chemical-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system.
3975902	3	497	The most distinctive aspect of the Doc_3975902_532_538_Chemical effect was a demonstrated Doc_3975902_565_581_Disease of the cardiovascular system to Doc_3975902_614_634_Chemical.
3975902	4	636	Under Doc_3975902_642_653_Chemical anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in Doc_3975902_750_756_Chemical-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats.
3975902	5	818	The lack of a similar response to Doc_3975902_852_860_Chemical and Doc_3975902_865_873_Chemical anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of Doc_3975902_929_949_Chemical in Doc_3975902_953_959_Chemical-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response.
3975902	6	1084	Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by Doc_3975902_1151_1157_Chemical were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed.
3975902	7	1214	The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of Doc_3975902_1330_1336_Chemical-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen.
3975902	8	1422	Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the Doc_3975902_1511_1517_Chemical-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity.
3975902	9	1611	In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from Doc_3975902_1755_1761_Chemical-exposed rats.
3975902	10	1776	Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the Doc_3975902_1900_1916_Disease of the cardiovascular system to Doc_3975902_1949_1969_Chemical suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed Doc_3975902_2020_2044_Disease induced by chronic Doc_3975902_2064_2070_Chemical exposure.

3987172	4	383	Doc_3987172_383_386_Chemical, 75 mg alone, increased blood pressure (31 +/- 14 mm Hg systolic, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg diastolic), and Doc_3987172_484_495_Chemical pretreatment antagonized this increase (12 +/- 10 mm Hg systolic, 10 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic).
3987172	5	589	Intravenous Doc_3987172_601_612_Chemical after Doc_3987172_619_622_Chemical also decreased blood pressure.
3987172	6	654	Left ventricular function (assessed by echocardiography) showed that Doc_3987172_723_726_Chemical increased the Doc_3987172_741_747_Disease volume 30% (from 62.5 +/- 20.9 to 80.8 +/- 22.4 ml), the ejection fraction 9% (from 64% +/- 10% to 70% +/- 7%), and cardiac output 14% (from 3.6 +/- 0.6 to 4.1 +/- 1.0 L/min).
3987172	7	924	Intravenous Doc_3987172_936_947_Chemical reversed these effects.
3987172	8	972	Systemic vascular resistance was increased by Doc_3987172_1018_1021_Chemical 28% (from 1710 +/- 200 to 2190 +/- 700 dyne X sec/cm5) and was further increased by Doc_3987172_1106_1117_Chemical 22% (to 2660 +/- 1200 dyne X sec/cm5).
3987172	9	1157	We conclude that Doc_3987172_1174_1177_Chemical increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and that Doc_3987172_1275_1286_Chemical antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of Doc_3987172_1340_1343_Chemical on cardiac output.
3987172	10	1363	That Doc_3987172_1368_1379_Chemical antagonizes the pressor effect of Doc_3987172_1414_1417_Chemical is in contrast to the interaction in which Doc_3987172_1461_1472_Chemical enhances the pressor effect of Doc_3987172_1504_1518_Chemical.
3987172	11	1520	This is probably because Doc_3987172_1545_1548_Chemical has less beta 2 activity than does Doc_3987172_1584_1598_Chemical.

3990093	1	84	The possible relationship between Doc_3990093_118_139_Disease and development of Doc_3990093_159_179_Disease was studied in the Doc_3990093_199_224_Chemical (Doc_3990093_226_229_Chemical) model.
3990093	2	238	Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous Doc_3990093_291_294_Chemical injections; five controls received saline only.
3990093	3	343	After 4 weeks the Doc_3990093_361_364_Chemical rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal Doc_3990093_453_459_Chemical (CC) intravenously.
3990093	4	480	At 5 months Doc_3990093_492_512_Disease was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of Doc_3990093_559_562_Chemical rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal.
3990093	5	608	Glomeruli of Doc_3990093_621_624_Chemical rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls.
3990093	6	690	Glomeruli with Doc_3990093_705_714_Disease contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys.
3990093	7	797	CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli.
3990093	8	883	Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic Doc_3990093_961_964_Chemical treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where Doc_3990093_1141_1150_Disease will develop subsequently.
3990093	9	1178	Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the Doc_3990093_1242_1245_Chemical glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model.
3990093	10	1351	Similar to the remnant kidney model in Doc_3990093_1390_1393_Chemical Doc_3990093_1394_1403_Disease the development of Doc_3990093_1423_1443_Disease may be related to "mesangial overloading."
4010471	0	0	Relationship between Doc_4010471_21_29_Chemical-induced Doc_4010471_38_46_Disease and hippocampal nicotinic receptors.
4010471	1	84	A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by Doc_4010471_205_223_Chemical binding.
4010471	2	233	Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between Doc_4010471_325_333_Chemical-induced Doc_4010471_342_350_Disease and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found.
4010471	3	418	Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of Doc_4010471_462_470_Chemical had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than Doc_4010471_534_541_Disease insensitive mice.
4010471	4	560	The binding sites from Doc_4010471_583_590_Disease sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with Doc_4010471_660_674_Chemical, trypsin or heat.
4010471	5	693	Thus it appears that the difference between Doc_4010471_737_744_Disease sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.

4082192	1	192	Doc_4082192_192_205_Chemical (Doc_4082192_207_211_Chemical) produces proximal Doc_4082192_231_247_Disease in Fischer 344 (F344) rats.
4082192	2	276	Recently, Doc_4082192_286_299_Chemical (Doc_4082192_301_304_Chemical), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of Doc_4082192_372_376_Chemical in F344 rats.
4082192	3	391	The purpose of this study was to determine if Doc_4082192_437_440_Chemical formation is a requisite step in Doc_4082192_474_478_Chemical-induced nephrotoxicity.
4082192	4	503	Therefore, the effect of Doc_4082192_528_556_Chemical (Doc_4082192_558_562_Chemical), an acylamidase inhibitor, on Doc_4082192_594_598_Chemical and Doc_4082192_603_606_Chemical nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined.
4082192	5	653	BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced Doc_4082192_678_682_Chemical deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner.
4082192	6	790	Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to Doc_4082192_833_837_Chemical or Doc_4082192_841_844_Chemical administration resulted in marked reduction of Doc_4082192_892_896_Chemical (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not Doc_4082192_932_935_Chemical nephrotoxicity.
4082192	7	952	This result was not due to altered disposition of either Doc_4082192_1009_1013_Chemical or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue.
4082192	8	1088	Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of Doc_4082192_1138_1142_Chemical excreted as Doc_4082192_1155_1158_Chemical by 64 and 75% after Doc_4082192_1179_1183_Chemical doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg.
4082192	9	1212	BNPP did not alter the excretion of Doc_4082192_1248_1252_Chemical or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of Doc_4082192_1328_1331_Chemical or its metabolites after Doc_4082192_1357_1360_Chemical doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg.
4082192	10	1389	Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in Doc_4082192_1430_1434_Chemical-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of Doc_4082192_1493_1497_Chemical deacetylation.
4082192	11	1513	It is concluded that Doc_4082192_1534_1537_Chemical formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for Doc_4082192_1590_1594_Chemical-induced Doc_4082192_1603_1625_Disease.

4082466	2	174	They received Doc_4082466_188_196_Chemical in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no Doc_4082466_334_342_Disease.
4082466	3	344	Plasma concentrations of Doc_4082466_369_377_Chemical in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml).
4082466	4	429	Other known reasons for Doc_4082466_453_461_Disease were ruled out and the Doc_4082466_485_496_Disease stopped a few hours after cessation of Doc_4082466_536_544_Chemical and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months.
4082466	5	593	It is suggested that post-operative intravenous Doc_4082466_641_649_Chemical should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.

44072	2	408	Four types of experimental Doc_44072_435_445_Disease are used--with Doc_44072_461_466_Chemical, with Doc_44072_473_483_Chemical-Doc_44072_484_494_Chemical, with Doc_44072_501_515_Chemical and with Doc_44072_525_534_Chemical.
44072	3	536	The compound P11 is introduced in doses of 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg intravenously and 10 mg/kg orally.
44072	4	634	The compound manifests antiarrhythmic activity in all models of experimental Doc_44072_711_721_Disease used, causing greatest inhibition on the Doc_44072_763_773_Disease induced by Doc_44072_785_795_Chemical-Doc_44072_796_806_Chemical (in 90 per cent) and with Doc_44072_833_838_Chemical (in 84 per cent).
44072	5	857	The results obtained are associated with the beta-adrenoblocking and with the membrane-stabilizing action of the compound.

448423	3	241	Although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding, several reports have described Doc_448423_335_345_Disease complications of Doc_448423_363_367_Chemical therapy.
448423	4	377	These complications have included clinical deterioration and Doc_448423_438_470_Disease in patients with Doc_448423_488_491_Disease, arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with Doc_448423_586_590_Chemical, or other Doc_448423_601_615_Disease phenomena.
448423	5	627	Since intravascular fibrin thrombi are often observed in patients with Doc_448423_698_720_Disease, Doc_448423_722_726_Chemical should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with disseminated Doc_448423_820_845_Disease or other "Doc_448423_856_882_Disease."
448423	6	885	This report describes subtotal Doc_448423_916_940_Disease due to Doc_448423_948_958_Disease of a normal renal artery.
448423	7	985	This occlusion occurred after Doc_448423_1015_1019_Chemical therapy in a patient with Doc_448423_1046_1049_Disease and histopathological documentation of recurrent Doc_448423_1099_1102_Disease.

4631913	2	329	Doc_4631913_329_341_Disease was observed in all monkeys.
4631913	3	371	Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of Doc_4631913_432_451_Chemical was followed by Doc_4631913_468_478_Disease in 4 to 5 days.
4631913	4	495	Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) Doc_4631913_551_557_Chemical type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given Doc_4631913_604_623_Chemical 4 days previously resulted in fatal Doc_4631913_660_669_Disease in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died.
4631913	5	746	These studies suggest that an Doc_4631913_776_790_Chemical-induced Doc_4631913_799_809_Disease predisposes to severe Doc_4631913_832_850_Disease and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
48835	0	0	Modification by Doc_48835_16_27_Chemical of cardiovascular effects of induced hypoglycaemia.
48835	1	80	The cardiovascular effects of hypoglycaemia, with and without beta-blockade, were compared in fourteen healthy men.
48835	2	196	Eight received insulin alone, and eight, including two of the original insulin-only group, were given Doc_48835_298_309_Chemical and insulin.
48835	3	323	In the insulin-group the period of hypoglycaemia was associated with an increase in heart-rate and a fall in diastolic blood-pressure.
48835	4	458	In the Doc_48835_465_476_Chemical-insulin group there was a significant fall in heart-rate in most subjects and an increase in diastolic pressure.
48835	5	590	Typical S-T/T changes occurred in the insulin-group but in none of the Doc_48835_661_672_Chemical-insulin group.
48835	6	688	Doc_48835_688_700_Disease in diabetics prone to hypoglycaemia attacks should not be treated with beta-blockers because these drugs may cause a sharp rise in blood-pressure in such patients.

573555	1	72	Doc_573555_72_83_Chemical, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, has found an important position in the practice of medicine.
573555	2	180	Its use in pregnancy, however, is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neonate.
573555	3	316	Ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic Doc_573555_375_386_Chemical has been administered.
573555	4	410	Five patients with serial pregnancies with and without Doc_573555_465_476_Chemical therapy are also examined.
573555	5	504	Maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications are examined.
573555	6	562	An attempt is made to differentiate drug-related complications from maternal disease--related complications.
573555	7	671	We conclude that previously reported Doc_573555_708_720_Disease, Doc_573555_722_740_Disease, Doc_573555_742_754_Disease, neonatal Doc_573555_765_770_Disease, and Doc_573555_776_787_Disease are not invariable and cannot be statistically correlated with chronic Doc_573555_859_870_Chemical therapy.
573555	8	880	Doc_573555_880_898_Disease, however, appears to be significant in both of our series.
6106951	0	0	Central excitatory actions of Doc_6106951_30_40_Chemical.
6106951	1	42	Toxic actions of Doc_6106951_59_69_Chemical (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats.
6106951	2	113	High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic Doc_6106951_191_202_Disease, superimposed on general Doc_6106951_228_238_Disease.
6106951	3	240	Following a lethal dose, Doc_6106951_265_270_Disease was always associated with Doc_6106951_298_309_Disease.
6106951	4	311	Comparing the relative sensitivity to central Doc_6106951_357_367_Disease and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have Doc_6106951_428_439_Disease at doses that did not first cause Doc_6106951_474_495_Disease, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions.
6106951	5	563	Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included Doc_6106951_602_622_Disease, extreme Doc_6106951_632_653_Disease, retching, muscle Doc_6106951_672_679_Disease and Doc_6106951_684_695_Disease.
6106951	6	697	An interaction between FZP and Doc_6106951_728_745_Chemical (Doc_6106951_747_750_Chemical) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before Doc_6106951_798_801_Chemical challenge.
6106951	7	813	As a function of dose, FZP first protected against Doc_6106951_864_875_Disease and Doc_6106951_880_885_Disease.
6106951	8	887	At higher doses, however, Doc_6106951_913_924_Disease again emerged.
6106951	9	940	These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause Doc_6106951_1004_1015_Disease.
6106951	10	1017	These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as Doc_6106951_1145_1153_Disease or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.
611664	0	0	Use of Doc_611664_7_18_Chemical in the treatment of Doc_611664_39_73_Disease.
611664	1	75	Five patients with Doc_611664_94_128_Disease who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe Doc_611664_184_205_Disease were included in the study.
611664	2	234	They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma Doc_611664_277_291_Chemical and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked Doc_611664_373_389_Disease to the pressor effects of infused Doc_611664_424_438_Chemical.
611664	3	440	Treatment with Doc_611664_455_465_Chemical administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced Doc_611664_511_557_Disease in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg.
611664	4	628	Chronic oral administration of Doc_611664_659_670_Chemical (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed.
611664	5	805	In 1 patient, marked Doc_611664_826_838_Disease was induced by Doc_611664_854_865_Chemical and the drug had to be withdrawn.
611664	6	900	It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed.
611664	7	977	Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time.
611664	8	1166	Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following Doc_611664_1322_1333_Chemical therapy.
611664	9	1343	The studies suggest that Doc_611664_1368_1379_Chemical is a useful drug in selected patients with severe Doc_611664_1430_1464_Disease.

612112	2	50	Some observations in adults.
612112	3	79	An investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of Doc_612112_138_147_Chemical required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesia.
612112	4	237	Premedication of Doc_612112_254_262_Chemical 10 mg and Doc_612112_273_281_Chemical 0.5 mg was given, and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of Doc_612112_379_388_Chemical 0.1/mg/kg, given whenever the patient would open his eyes on request.
612112	5	459	A mean overall dose of Doc_612112_482_491_Chemical 17.4 microgram/kg/min. was required to maintain sleep, but great individual variation occurred, with older patients requiring less drug.
612112	6	629	The investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side-effects, particularly Doc_612112_751_755_Disease and myoclonia, which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cases.
612112	7	828	It is considered unlikely that Doc_612112_859_868_Chemical will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myoclonia after prolonged administration.
612112	8	1041	In several patients uncontrollable muscle movements persisted for many minutes after complete recovery of consciousness.
6299641	0	0	Evidence for cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man.
6299641	1	50	We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg Doc_6299641_99_107_Chemical (cardioselective), 40 mg Doc_6299641_133_144_Chemical (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and Doc_6299641_195_208_Chemical-induced Doc_6299641_217_228_Disease in two experiments involving nine normal subjects.
6299641	2	280	Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after Doc_6299641_377_385_Chemical and 138 +/- 6 bpm after Doc_6299641_410_421_Chemical, but there were no differences between the drugs.
6299641	3	472	The effects on Doc_6299641_487_500_Chemical Doc_6299641_501_512_Disease were determined before and after Doc_6299641_546_554_Chemical (0.04 mg/kg IV).
6299641	4	572	Doc_6299641_572_585_Chemical sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after Doc_6299641_778_789_Chemical and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after Doc_6299641_823_831_Chemical.
6299641	5	833	The difference in the effects of the two was significant.
6299641	6	891	After Doc_6299641_897_905_Chemical the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and Doc_6299641_972_980_Chemical (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after Doc_6299641_1028_1039_Chemical (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from Doc_6299641_1095_1103_Chemical.
6299641	7	1105	This change with Doc_6299641_1122_1133_Chemical sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by Doc_6299641_1203_1211_Chemical (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng).
6299641	8	1251	These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced Doc_6299641_1319_1330_Disease results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas Doc_6299641_1451_1464_Chemical activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug.
6299641	9	1627	While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.
6305660	0	0	Hormones and risk of Doc_6305660_21_34_Disease.
6305660	1	36	This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy.
6305660	2	141	The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years.
6305660	3	214	It was hypothesized that Doc_6305660_239_249_Chemical could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy.
6305660	4	398	The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated Doc_6305660_445_454_Chemical (Doc_6305660_456_464_Chemical) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Doc_6305660_494_521_Chemical 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month.
6305660	5	559	The mean treatment period was 18 months.
6305660	6	600	During the follow-up period, attention was Doc_6305660_643_671_Disease as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography.
6305660	7	750	Doc_6305660_750_760_Disease was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light Doc_6305660_832_859_Disease in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women.
6305660	8	929	Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate Doc_6305660_1038_1048_Disease and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe Doc_6305660_1098_1108_Disease.
6305660	9	1110	Normalization was obtained by halving the Doc_6305660_1152_1160_Chemical dose.
6305660	10	1167	These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.

6316193	6	1015	Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the Doc_6316193_1112_1123_Chemical derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE.
6316193	7	1206	Of the CCK-2-8 analogues, Ser(Doc_6316193_1236_1240_Chemical)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Thr(Doc_6316193_1265_1269_Chemical)7-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE and Hyp(Doc_6316193_1294_1298_Chemical)-Ac-CCK-2-8-SE were slightly more active than CCK-8-SE.

6321816	1	55	The role of Doc_6321816_67_78_Chemical as a pressor agent to the Doc_6321816_105_117_Disease process was examined.
6321816	2	140	Doc_6321816_140_151_Chemical plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Doc_6321816_194_198_Chemical-salt Doc_6321816_204_216_Disease, since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with Doc_6321816_293_300_Chemical-treated Doc_6321816_309_327_Disease after Doc_6321816_334_338_Chemical-salt treatment.
6321816	3	355	Administration of Doc_6321816_373_378_Chemical which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasopressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of Doc_6321816_521_524_Chemical.
6321816	4	526	Furthermore, the pressor action of Doc_6321816_561_572_Chemical appears to be important in the development of this model of Doc_6321816_633_645_Disease, since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of Doc_6321816_741_753_Disease.
6321816	5	755	Increased secretion of Doc_6321816_778_789_Chemical from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in Doc_6321816_881_893_Disease.
6321816	6	895	An unproportional release of Doc_6321816_924_935_Chemical compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for Doc_6321816_1080_1086_Chemical balance in the brain.
6321816	7	1109	However, the role of Doc_6321816_1130_1141_Chemical remains to be determined in human essential Doc_6321816_1186_1198_Disease.

6529939	0	0	Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent Doc_6529939_42_58_Disease induced by Doc_6529939_70_81_Chemical.
6529939	1	83	Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for Doc_6529939_205_211_Disease with 80 mg Doc_6529939_223_234_Chemical daily.
6529939	2	242	The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses.
6529939	3	338	These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle.
6529939	4	504	Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval.
6529939	5	597	The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively.
6529939	6	710	The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle.
6529939	7	839	In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed.
6529939	8	941	This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm.
6529939	9	1067	There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals.
6529939	10	1139	S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen.
6529939	11	1395	Doc_6529939_1395_1403_Chemical 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm.
6529939	12	1502	The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of Doc_6529939_1557_1568_Chemical and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen.
6529939	13	1627	This was accepted as evidence for Doc_6529939_1661_1672_Chemical being the cause of this Doc_6529939_1697_1716_Disease.

6585590	2	291	Animals with a Doc_6585590_306_311_Disease (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of Doc_6585590_375_386_Chemical on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt).
6585590	3	492	Doc_6585590_492_497_Disease regression was observed with 0.5 mg Doc_6585590_534_545_Chemical/kg.
6585590	4	550	Complete disappearance of the Doc_6585590_580_585_Disease was induced with 1.0 mg Doc_6585590_610_621_Chemical/kg.
6585590	5	626	Histologic evidence of Doc_6585590_649_663_Disease scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg Doc_6585590_722_733_Chemical/kg.
6585590	6	738	Light microscopic evidence of Doc_6585590_768_780_Disease was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg Doc_6585590_813_824_Chemical/kg, which resulted in Doc_6585590_847_858_Disease and very low serum albumin levels.
6585590	7	894	In the group that received 1.0 mg Doc_6585590_928_939_Chemical/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter.
6585590	8	1020	Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously.
6585590	9	1074	The same experiments were performed with non-Doc_6585590_1119_1124_Disease-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed.
6585590	10	1184	In conclusion, antitumor activity, Doc_6585590_1219_1233_Disease, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat.
6585590	11	1309	Doc_6585590_1309_1320_Disease due to Doc_6585590_1328_1340_Disease led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed Doc_6585590_1462_1476_Disease.

6615679	2	279	Both Doc_6615679_284_291_Chemical and Doc_6615679_296_307_Chemical were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine.
6615679	3	368	Doc_6615679_368_375_Chemical (but not Doc_6615679_385_396_Chemical) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery; the plasma concentration of Doc_6615679_485_492_Chemical (2.6 ng ml-1) was consistent with partial beta-adrenoceptor blockade.
6615679	4	563	It is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during Doc_6615679_627_636_Chemical anaesthesia with resultant Doc_6615679_664_675_Disease and Doc_6615679_680_691_Disease.

6627074	2	294	Doc_6627074_294_305_Chemical 10 mg, given 74 min after Doc_6627074_332_347_Chemical, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained.
6627074	3	471	Repeated doses of Doc_6627074_489_500_Chemical to 70 mg and Doc_6627074_514_525_Chemical to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block.
6627074	4	577	Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after Doc_6627074_627_642_Chemical administration.
6627074	5	659	It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in Doc_6627074_768_783_Chemical apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block.

6985297	2	269	In vitro perfusion of Doc_6985297_291_299_Chemical in the life-support medium for isolated sino-atrial tissue from rabbit heart, caused a reduction in action potential (AP) spike frequency (recorded by Doc_6985297_451_454_Chemical microelectrodes) starting at doses of 5 X 10(-6) M.
6985297	3	507	This effect was dose-dependent up to concentrations of 5 X 10(-5) M, whereupon blockade of sinus activity set in.
6985297	4	621	Doc_6985297_621_629_Chemical at a dose of 5 X 10(-6) M, induced a concomitant reduction in AP amplitude (falling from 71 +/- 8 mV to 47 +/- 6 mV), maximum systolic depolarization velocity (phase 0) which fell from 1.85 +/- 0.35 V/s to 0.84 +/- 0.28 V/s, together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity (phase 4) which fell from 38 +/- 3 mV/s to 24 +/- 5 mV/s.

7479194	1	140	We conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed Doc_7479194_233_262_Chemical (Doc_7479194_264_267_Chemical-SMZ), 266,951 prescribed Doc_7479194_293_305_Chemical alone, and 196,397 prescribed Doc_7479194_336_346_Chemical, to estimate the risk of serious liver, blood, skin, and Doc_7479194_404_419_Disease resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs.
7479194	2	490	The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom, together with a review of clinical records.
7479194	3	658	The risk of clinically important Doc_7479194_691_715_Disease was similar for persons prescribed Doc_7479194_751_754_Chemical-SMZ (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed Doc_7479194_794_806_Chemical alone (3.8/100,000).
7479194	4	828	The risk for those prescribed Doc_7479194_858_868_Chemical was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000).
7479194	5	903	Only five patients experienced Doc_7479194_934_949_Disease, one of whom was exposed to Doc_7479194_978_981_Chemical-SMZ; of seven with Doc_7479194_1001_1020_Disease and Doc_7479194_1025_1049_Disease, four were exposed to Doc_7479194_1072_1075_Chemical-SMZ.

753803	1	98	We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive Doc_753803_197_215_Disease in man.
753803	2	224	Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view.
753803	3	419	Doc_753803_419_427_Disease due to lack of Doc_753803_443_452_Chemical and Doc_753803_457_465_Disease induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form.
753803	4	566	The authors induced Doc_753803_586_598_Disease in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in Doc_753803_641_650_Chemical.
753803	5	652	The pharmacological characteristics of Doc_753803_691_700_Chemical and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency, especially in the muscles, are illustrated.
753803	6	807	It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of Doc_753803_869_878_Disease rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human Doc_753803_959_967_Disease as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre, Florence.
753803	7	1060	The encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in Doc_753803_1133_1142_Disease patients by using anabolizing Doc_753803_1173_1181_Chemical have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent (Doc_753803_1274_1282_Chemical, Doc_753803_1284_1288_Chemical) at high doses in rats rendered Doc_753803_1321_1330_Disease by a diet deficient in Doc_753803_1354_1363_Chemical.
753803	8	1365	In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight (increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to "regenerative" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its Doc_753803_1648_1657_Disease characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent.
753803	9	1747	The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing Doc_753803_1823_1831_Chemical in experimental Doc_753803_1848_1865_Disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the Doc_753803_2063_2076_Disease too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the "regeneration" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the Doc_753803_2194_2214_Disease agent is certainly not the lack of Doc_753803_2250_2259_Chemical but something as yet unknown.

7644931	2	306	Doc_7644931_306_317_Chemical was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the Calvert formula, whereas Doc_7644931_425_435_Chemical was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 (dose level I) to 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2.
7644931	3	532	The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic Doc_7644931_681_691_Disease (Doc_7644931_693_703_Disease and Doc_7644931_708_726_Disease).

7661171	1	114	Doc_7661171_114_125_Chemical (200 micrograms) has been shown to acutely counteract the Doc_7661171_184_196_Chemical-induced Doc_7661171_205_222_Disease in well compensated cirrhotic patients.
7661171	2	263	The aim of this study was to determine if the prophylactic value of Doc_7661171_331_342_Chemical was dose-dependent.
7661171	3	363	Parameters of renal hemodynamics and tubular Doc_7661171_408_414_Chemical and water handling were assessed by clearance techniques in 26 well compensated cirrhotic patients before and after an oral combination of 50 mg of Doc_7661171_563_575_Chemical and various doses of Doc_7661171_597_608_Chemical.
7661171	4	610	The 200-micrograms dose was able to totally abolish the deleterious renal effects of Doc_7661171_695_707_Chemical, whereas the 800-micrograms dose resulted in significant worsening of renal hemodynamics and Doc_7661171_801_807_Chemical retention.
7661171	5	819	These changes were maximal in the hour immediately after medications and slowly returned toward base-line levels thereafter.
7661171	6	944	These results suggest that the renal protective effects of Doc_7661171_1003_1014_Chemical is dose-dependent.
7661171	7	1034	However, until this apparent ability of 200 micrograms of Doc_7661171_1092_1103_Chemical to prevent the adverse effects of Doc_7661171_1138_1150_Chemical on renal function is confirmed with chronic frequent dosing, it would be prudent to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy in patients with Doc_7661171_1297_1306_Disease.

7739955	2	266	Three patients had acute Doc_7739955_291_308_Disease, one had a Doc_7739955_320_333_Chemical-induced acute Doc_7739955_348_372_Disease, and one had cardiac Doc_7739955_394_407_Disease resulting in acute Doc_7739955_427_444_Disease.
7739955	3	446	All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring.
7739955	4	577	An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant Doc_7739955_728_748_Disease.

7739955	6	941	Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
7739955	7	1048	In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output.
7739955	8	1173	These patients had a second event of Doc_7739955_1210_1224_Disease, resulting in Doc_7739955_1239_1244_Disease, within 10 to 60 minutes.
7739955	9	1271	In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR.
7739955	10	1429	We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from Doc_7739955_1527_1555_Disease may not have long-term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.

8392553	4	574	Left ventricular alpha and beta adrenoceptor densities were also reduced compared to controls.
8392553	5	669	Treatment with Doc_8392553_684_694_Chemical prevented Doc_8392553_705_716_Chemical-induced Doc_8392553_725_730_Disease (P < .05), and attenuated the Doc_8392553_761_789_Disease and Doc_8392553_794_802_Disease, in a dose-dependent manner.
8392553	6	832	Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to Doc_8392553_907_920_Chemical were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with Doc_8392553_978_988_Chemical alone, but combined with Doc_8392553_1014_1025_Chemical, Doc_8392553_1027_1037_Chemical restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to Doc_8392553_1122_1135_Chemical.
8392553	7	1137	On the other hand Doc_8392553_1155_1165_Chemical did not prevent Doc_8392553_1182_1193_Chemical-induced down-regulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors.
8392553	8	1251	Interestingly, Doc_8392553_1266_1276_Chemical, infused alone, resulted in decreased adrenergic receptor densities in the left ventricle.
8392553	9	1368	Doc_8392553_1368_1378_Chemical also did not prevent the enhanced responses to Doc_8392553_1426_1433_Chemical seen in the Doc_8392553_1446_1457_Chemical-treated animals, although the high dose of Doc_8392553_1501_1511_Chemical partially attenuated the maximal response to Doc_8392553_1557_1564_Chemical compared to Doc_8392553_1577_1588_Chemical-treated animals.
8392553	10	1606	In conclusion, Doc_8392553_1621_1631_Chemical attenuated Doc_8392553_1643_1654_Chemical-induced Doc_8392553_1663_1677_Disease, possibly through its effect on the adrenergic pathway.

851038	2	154	The influence of Doc_851038_171_177_Chemical on the renal excretion of Doc_851038_204_213_Chemical was studied in 3 patients with Doc_851038_245_256_Disease and in 5 normokalemic patients by determination of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma concentration of Doc_851038_379_388_Chemical and Doc_851038_393_399_Chemical as well as urinary excretion of Doc_851038_432_441_Chemical, Doc_851038_443_449_Chemical and Doc_851038_454_465_Chemical.
851038	3	467	Doc_851038_467_473_Chemical intake was found to cause an increased excretion of Doc_851038_526_535_Chemical, and sometimes also of Doc_851038_559_565_Chemical, in the Doc_851038_574_585_Disease but not in the normokalemic patients.
851038	4	624	This effect on the renal function could be prohibited by the administration of a peripheral dopa decarbodylase inhibitor.
851038	5	746	It is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others, but our results indicate a correlation between Doc_851038_873_884_Chemical production and this renal effect of Doc_851038_921_927_Chemical.

8603459	1	75	A new model to test potential protectors.
8603459	2	117	In laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study Doc_8603459_181_192_Chemical-induced Doc_8603459_201_215_Disease.
8603459	3	217	However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed.
8603459	4	296	Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry.
8603459	5	389	With this model we investigated the effect of chronic Doc_8603459_443_454_Chemical administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of Doc_8603459_530_538_Chemical as a protective agent.
8603459	6	562	The ST interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 (7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg Doc_8603459_676_687_Chemical given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation).
8603459	7	729	The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study.
8603459	8	800	After sacrifice the hearts of Doc_8603459_830_841_Chemical-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were Doc_8603459_891_903_Disease.
8603459	9	905	As this schedule exerted more Doc_8603459_935_943_Disease than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of Doc_8603459_1008_1016_Chemical was determined using a dose schedule with lower general Doc_8603459_1073_1081_Disease (6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg Doc_8603459_1109_1120_Chemical given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation).
8603459	10	1162	On this schedule, the animals' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and Doc_8603459_1236_1244_Chemical (50 mg/kg given i.p. 1 h before Doc_8603459_1277_1288_Chemical) provided almost full protection.
8603459	11	1323	These data were confirmed by histology.
8603459	12	1363	The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of Doc_8603459_1467_1481_Disease with time.
8603459	13	1493	These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against Doc_8603459_1572_1583_Chemical-induced Doc_8603459_1592_1606_Disease as demonstrated by the protection provided by Doc_8603459_1653_1661_Chemical.
8659767	0	0	Doc_8659767_0_11_Chemical dysrhythmogenicity is not enhanced by subtoxic Doc_8659767_59_70_Chemical in dogs.
8659767	1	80	Since Doc_8659767_86_97_Chemical and Doc_8659767_102_113_Chemical may both precipitate Doc_8659767_135_147_Disease, circulating Doc_8659767_161_172_Chemical during regional anesthesia could potentiate dysrhythmogenic effects of Doc_8659767_244_255_Chemical.
8659767	2	257	We therefore examined whether Doc_8659767_287_298_Chemical alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of Doc_8659767_361_372_Chemical in conscious, healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with Doc_8659767_430_451_Disease.
8659767	3	453	Forty-one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 Doc_8659767_512_523_Chemical.
8659767	4	525	Seventeen animals responded with Doc_8659767_558_581_Disease (Doc_8659767_583_585_Disease) within 3 min.
8659767	5	601	After 3 h, these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg/kg Doc_8659767_660_671_Chemical or saline over 5 min, followed by 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 Doc_8659767_731_742_Chemical.
8659767	6	744	In the Doc_8659767_751_762_Chemical groups, Doc_8659767_771_782_Chemical caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without Doc_8659767_832_843_Chemical.
8659767	7	845	Doc_8659767_845_847_Disease appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time, and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies.
8659767	8	948	Doc_8659767_948_959_Chemical shortened QT less after Doc_8659767_984_995_Chemical than in control animals.
8659767	9	1021	One day after experimental Doc_8659767_1048_1069_Disease, six additional Doc_8659767_1086_1095_Chemical-anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 Doc_8659767_1147_1158_Chemical until Doc_8659767_1165_1167_Disease appeared.
8659767	10	1178	After 45 min, 1 mg/kg Doc_8659767_1200_1211_Chemical was injected over 5 min, again followed by 4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 Doc_8659767_1279_1290_Chemical.
8659767	11	1292	In these dogs, the prodysrhythmic response to Doc_8659767_1338_1349_Chemical was also mitigated by preceding Doc_8659767_1382_1393_Chemical.

8667442	3	486	Doc_8667442_486_506_Disease can present serious and occasionally life-threatening illness unless diagnosed and treated appropriately.
8667442	4	613	This article presents a patient with Doc_8667442_650_668_Disease who was treated with Doc_8667442_690_707_Chemical and Doc_8667442_712_722_Chemical resulting in two admissions to the hospital for Doc_8667442_771_791_Disease.

8748050	1	123	This report describes a case of Doc_8748050_155_169_Disease developed in the course of Doc_8748050_197_210_Chemical therapy, during a remission of Doc_8748050_242_261_Disease.
8748050	2	263	This patient could have been diagnosed as having either Doc_8748050_319_349_Disease (Doc_8748050_351_354_Disease) or Doc_8748050_359_368_Chemical syndrome (Doc_8748050_379_381_Disease).
8748050	3	384	The major determinant of the symptoms may have been Doc_8748050_436_444_Chemical/Doc_8748050_445_454_Chemical imbalance in the central nervous system.

8755612	2	212	Ten weeks of Doc_8755612_225_243_Chemical (Doc_8755612_245_248_Chemical) treatment caused female F344 rat pituitaries to grow to an average of 109.2 +/- 6.3 mg (mean +/- SE) versus 11.3 +/- 1.4 mg for untreated rats, and to become highly Doc_8755612_415_426_Disease.
8755612	3	428	The same Doc_8755612_437_440_Chemical treatment produced no significant growth (8.9 +/- 0.5 mg for treated females versus 8.7 +/- 1.1 for untreated females) or morphological changes in Brown Norway (BN) rat pituitaries.
8755612	4	623	An F1 hybrid of F344 and BN exhibited significant pituitary growth after 10 weeks of Doc_8755612_708_711_Chemical treatment with an average mass of 26.3 +/- 0.7 mg compared with 8.6 +/- 0.9 mg for untreated rats.
8755612	5	811	Surprisingly, the F1 hybrid Doc_8755612_839_845_Disease were not Doc_8755612_855_866_Disease and had hemoglobin content and outward appearance identical to that of BN.
8755612	6	942	Expression of both growth and morphological changes is due to multiple genes.
8755612	7	1020	However, while Doc_8755612_1035_1038_Chemical-induced pituitary growth exhibited quantitative, additive inheritance, the Doc_8755612_1114_1125_Disease phenotype exhibited recessive, epistatic inheritance.
8755612	8	1180	Only 5 of the 160 F2 pituitaries exhibited the Doc_8755612_1227_1238_Disease phenotype; 36 of the 160 F2 pituitaries were in the F344 range of mass, but 31 of these were not Doc_8755612_1336_1347_Disease, indicating that the Doc_8755612_1369_1380_Disease phenotype is not merely a consequence of extensive growth.
8755612	9	1440	The Doc_8755612_1444_1455_Disease F2 pituitaries were all among the most massive, indicating that some of the genes regulate both phenotypes.
8808730	0	0	Increased expression of neuronal Doc_8808730_33_45_Chemical synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic Doc_8808730_102_120_Disease.
8808730	1	122	Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal Doc_8808730_215_227_Chemical synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat.
8808730	2	335	Doc_8808730_335_352_Disease was induced by Doc_8808730_368_384_Chemical (CYP) which is metabolized to Doc_8808730_415_423_Chemical, an irritant eliminated in the urine.
8808730	3	462	Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter.
8808730	4	778	Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks).
8808730	5	913	In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG).
8808730	6	1095	Chronic Doc_8808730_1103_1106_Chemical administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG.
8808730	7	1288	A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG.
8808730	8	1394	Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%).
8808730	9	1703	These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.

8819482	2	357	In the presence of Doc_8819482_376_400_Disease, 3-min periods of intracoronary Doc_8819482_433_436_Chemical infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram.
8819482	3	660	After the control Doc_8819482_678_681_Chemical infusion with Doc_8819482_696_704_Disease was performed, equihypotensive doses of Doc_8819482_745_751_Chemical (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), Doc_8819482_789_799_Chemical (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or Doc_8819482_838_847_Chemical (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third Doc_8819482_943_946_Chemical infusion.

8825380	1	119	We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and Doc_8825380_198_215_Disease in chronic Doc_8825380_227_252_Chemical (Doc_8825380_254_257_Chemical) Doc_8825380_259_270_Disease, an experimental model of Doc_8825380_297_315_Disease.
8825380	2	317	Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of Doc_8825380_421_435_Disease in rats with chronic Doc_8825380_457_460_Chemical Doc_8825380_461_472_Disease.

8825380	4	551	Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved Doc_8825380_684_695_Disease by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with Doc_8825380_774_787_Disease.
8825380	5	789	Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic Doc_8825380_871_874_Chemical Doc_8825380_875_886_Disease.
8825380	6	888	After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated Doc_8825380_1034_1037_Chemical Doc_8825380_1038_1049_Disease animals, p < 0.05.
8825380	7	1069	The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced Doc_8825380_1125_1147_Disease or increased Doc_8825380_1161_1189_Disease, Doc_8825380_1191_1216_Disease, or renal cortical Doc_8825380_1236_1251_Chemical content.
8825380	8	1261	In rats with Doc_8825380_1274_1277_Chemical Doc_8825380_1278_1289_Disease, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA.
8825380	9	1430	In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter Doc_8825380_1511_1522_Disease, blood pressure, Doc_8825380_1540_1551_Disease, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical Doc_8825380_1597_1612_Chemical content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors.
8825380	10	1838	We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic Doc_8825380_1930_1933_Chemical Doc_8825380_1934_1945_Disease and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and Doc_8825380_2028_2045_Disease in this disease model.

8829135	2	277	Given that Doc_8829135_288_299_Chemical inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period, we evaluated the ability of Doc_8829135_437_448_Chemical to attenuate Doc_8829135_462_469_Disease induced by dopaminergic agonism.
8829135	3	503	A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and Doc_8829135_559_570_Chemical (3 mg/kg) and Doc_8829135_585_596_Chemical (0.5 mg/kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation.

895432	5	589	Forty-eight hours after the final exercise period, Doc_895432_640_643_Chemical and E-I animals received a single subcutaneous injection of Doc_895432_704_717_Chemical (250 mg/kg body weight).
895432	6	743	Animals of the Doc_895432_758_761_Chemical group exhibited significantly (Pp less than 0.05) greater mortality from the effects of Doc_895432_850_863_Chemical than animals of the E-I group.
895432	7	895	Serum CPK activity for E-I animals was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than for animals in the Doc_895432_999_1002_Chemical and EC groups twenty hours following Doc_895432_1040_1053_Chemical injection.

8957205	5	722	The Doc_8957205_726_729_Chemical-response curves for the two tests were compared within the same subject.
8957205	6	803	In the hCRH group a marked parallel shift of the Doc_8957205_852_855_Chemical-response curve to the left was observed after hCRH (P < 0.01).
8957205	7	919	The same effect occurred following Doc_8957205_954_957_Chemical but was less striking (P = 0.05).
8957205	8	992	hCRH and Doc_8957205_1001_1004_Chemical caused a reduction in the Doc_8957205_1031_1034_Chemical threshold.

8985298	4	610	The drug was given for 4 weeks.
8985298	5	642	The patients were closely monitored clinically, biochemically, and serologically up to 4 weeks after drug treatment.

8996419	0	0	Population-based study of risk of Doc_8996419_34_56_Disease associated with various Doc_8996419_81_100_Chemical.
8996419	1	102	Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of Doc_8996419_190_212_Disease (Doc_8996419_214_217_Disease) was higher in women who used Doc_8996419_248_267_Chemical (OCs) containing the third-generation Doc_8996419_306_318_Chemical gestodene or Doc_8996419_332_343_Chemical than in users of OCs containing second-generation progestagens.
8996419	2	408	However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings.
8996419	3	501	The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of Doc_8996419_572_575_Disease and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies.
8996419	4	696	We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK.
8996419	5	780	The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981.
8996419	6	874	All women who had a recorded diagnosis of Doc_8996419_916_936_Disease, Doc_8996419_938_955_Disease not otherwise specified, or Doc_8996419_984_1001_Disease during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of Doc_8996419_1112_1115_Disease.
8996419	7	1117	We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of Doc_8996419_1179_1182_Disease in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of Doc_8996419_1285_1288_Disease associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors.
8996419	8	1387	In the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs.
8996419	9	1501	We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease.
8996419	10	1701	85 women met the inclusion criteria for Doc_8996419_1751_1754_Disease, two of whom were users of progestagen-only OCs.
8996419	11	1804	Of the 83 cases of Doc_8996419_1823_1826_Disease associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as Doc_8996419_1884_1904_Disease, 35 as Doc_8996419_1912_1932_Disease, and five as Doc_8996419_1946_1963_Disease not otherwise specified.
8996419	12	1989	The crude rate of Doc_8996419_2007_2010_Disease per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any OC, 3.10 in users of second-generation OCs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations.
8996419	13	2163	After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of Doc_8996419_2207_2210_Disease in users of third-generation relative to second-generation OCs was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.75).
8996419	14	2303	Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of Doc_8996419_2371_2374_Disease between users of third-generation and second-generation OCs.
8996419	15	2436	Among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of Doc_8996419_2494_2497_Disease was higher in users of Doc_8996419_2521_2532_Chemical with 20 g Doc_8996419_2543_2560_Chemical than in users of Doc_8996419_2578_2587_Chemical or Doc_8996419_2591_2602_Chemical with 30 g Doc_8996419_2613_2630_Chemical.
8996419	16	2632	With all second-generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for Doc_8996419_2701_2704_Disease were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for Doc_8996419_2732_2743_Chemical plus 20 g Doc_8996419_2754_2771_Chemical and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens.
8996419	17	2838	The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation OCs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age.
8996419	18	3050	The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms Doc_8996419_3125_3142_Chemical and Doc_8996419_3147_3158_Chemical compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.

9125676	8	1397	However, the oral dose of Doc_9125676_1423_1434_Chemical was significantly lower in patients with Doc_9125676_1476_1495_Disease (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017).
9125676	9	1544	Risk factors associated with the development of Doc_9125676_1592_1611_Disease were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05).
9125676	10	1774	During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal Doc_9125676_1828_1851_Disease recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly.

9128918	1	60	The tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) system is known to inhibit prolactin (PRL) secretion.
9128918	2	157	In young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum PRL by increasing its activity.
9128918	3	256	However, this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum PRL levels.
9128918	4	347	The purpose of this study was to induce Doc_9128918_387_405_Disease in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the brain.
9128918	5	505	Doc_9128918_505_523_Disease was induced by treatment with Doc_9128918_554_565_Chemical, a Doc_9128918_569_577_Chemical receptor antagonist, and Palkovits' microdissection technique in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the brain.

9128918	7	918	Nine months of Doc_9128918_933_951_Disease produced a 50% increase in DA concentrations in the ME over the control group.
9128918	8	1031	However, DA response was lost if a 9-month long Doc_9128918_1079_1090_Chemical-induced Doc_9128918_1099_1117_Disease was followed by a 1 1/2 month-long extremely high increase in serum PRL levels produced by implantation of MMQ cells under the kidney capsule.
9128918	9	1261	There was no change in the levels of DA, Doc_9128918_1302_1316_Chemical (NE), Doc_9128918_1323_1332_Chemical (Doc_9128918_1334_1338_Chemical), or their metabolites in the Doc_9128918_1369_1384_Disease (Doc_9128918_1386_1388_Disease), medial preoptic area (MPA), caudate putamen (CP), substantia nigra (SN), and zona incerta (ZI), except for a decrease in Doc_9128918_1512_1538_Chemical (Doc_9128918_1540_1546_Chemical) in the Doc_9128918_1555_1557_Disease after 6-months of Doc_9128918_1576_1594_Disease and an increase in DA concentrations in the Doc_9128918_1639_1641_Disease after 9-months of Doc_9128918_1660_1678_Disease.
9128918	10	1680	These results demonstrate that Doc_9128918_1711_1729_Disease specifically affects TIDA neurons and these effects vary, depending on the duration and intensity of Doc_9128918_1831_1849_Disease.
9128918	11	1851	The age-related decrease in hypothalamic Doc_9128918_1892_1900_Chemical function may be associated with increases in PRL secretion.

9158667	1	97	A case of Doc_9158667_107_126_Disease, due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with Doc_9158667_180_208_Disease (Doc_9158667_210_213_Disease) treated with Doc_9158667_228_251_Chemical (Doc_9158667_253_257_Chemical) and Doc_9158667_263_278_Chemical has been described recently.
9158667	2	308	We report a case of Doc_9158667_328_347_Disease in an Doc_9158667_354_357_Disease patient treated with Doc_9158667_379_383_Chemical alone.
9158667	3	391	This case further supports the concern about Doc_9158667_436_450_Disease complications associated with Doc_9158667_481_485_Chemical therapy in Doc_9158667_497_500_Disease patients.
9158667	4	511	The patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of Doc_9158667_584_587_Disease and was included in a treatment protocol with Doc_9158667_634_638_Chemical.
9158667	5	640	After 10 days of treatment, he developed Doc_9158667_681_700_Disease that was completely reversible after complete remission of Doc_9158667_760_763_Disease was achieved and therapy discontinued.
9158667	6	803	We conclude that Doc_9158667_820_824_Chemical is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with Doc_9158667_873_876_Disease, although the procoagulant tendency is not completely corrected.

9197951	1	93	A 30-year-old Doc_9197951_107_114_Chemical-dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the anticraving efficacy of the stimulant medication Doc_9197951_222_236_Chemical (DEP) became Doc_9197951_250_255_Disease during his second week on the study drug.
9197951	2	298	Pupillometric changes while on DEP, especially changes in the total power of Doc_9197951_375_396_Disease, were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become Doc_9197951_499_504_Disease.
9197951	3	506	The large changes in total power of Doc_9197951_542_563_Disease occurred a few days before the patient became fully Doc_9197951_616_621_Disease.
9197951	4	623	Such medication-associated changes in the total power of Doc_9197951_680_701_Disease might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for Doc_9197951_757_762_Disease-like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympathomimetic agents.

9272404	0	0	The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man.
9272404	1	92	We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central Doc_9272404_158_162_Disease-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, Doc_9272404_300_303_Chemical) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs.
9272404	2	372	For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and Doc_9272404_505_515_Disease by either central or peripheral mechanisms.
9272404	3	560	According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg Doc_9272404_744_753_Chemical, or 800 mg Doc_9272404_765_774_Chemical.
9272404	4	776	Phasic Doc_9272404_783_787_Disease was applied by means of short pulses of Doc_9272404_828_831_Chemical to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and Doc_9272404_913_923_Disease was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1).
9272404	5	1076	Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of Doc_9272404_1136_1140_Disease were obtained in response to the Doc_9272404_1174_1177_Chemical stimuli.
9272404	6	1187	Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and Doc_9272404_1253_1263_Disease by means of visual analogue scales.
9272404	7	1300	As described earlier, administration of Doc_9272404_1349_1358_Chemical was followed by a decrease in Doc_9272404_1389_1399_Disease but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic Doc_9272404_1460_1464_Disease, indicating a specific effect of Doc_9272404_1498_1507_Chemical on the interaction between the Doc_9272404_1539_1543_Disease stimuli under these special experimental conditions.
9272404	8	1597	Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery.
9272404	9	1755	By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID.
9272404	10	1951	The major advantage of this Doc_9272404_1979_1983_Disease model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral Doc_9272404_2033_2037_Disease-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.

9570197	3	431	METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients (14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of Doc_9570197_567_577_Disease, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline (n=10, control subjects) or Doc_9570197_833_854_Chemical 1 mg/min (n=10).
9570197	4	872	No variable changed with saline.
9570197	5	905	With Doc_9570197_910_917_Chemical, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 (mean+/-SD) mg/L, similar in magnitude to the blood Doc_9570197_1050_1057_Chemical concentration reported in abusers dying of Doc_9570197_1101_1108_Chemical intoxication.
9570197	6	1123	Doc_9570197_1123_1130_Chemical induced no significant change in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV end-systolic volume, as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction.
9570197	7	1406	In humans, the intracoronary infusion of Doc_9570197_1460_1467_Chemical sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance.

9881641	2	369	The results were also compared with those of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP).
9881641	3	455	Doc_9881641_455_465_Chemical produced Doc_9881641_475_486_Disease in a dose-dependent manner with approximately similar potency and duration to VIP.
9881641	4	570	Doc_9881641_570_581_Disease induced by both peptides was significantly attenuated by Doc_9881641_639_652_Chemical, which abolished a levcromakalim-produced decrease in arterial blood pressure.
9881641	5	732	Oxyhemoglobin did not affect Doc_9881641_761_771_Chemical-induced Doc_9881641_780_791_Disease, whereas it shortened the duration of Doc_9881641_830_843_Chemical (Doc_9881641_845_848_Chemical)-produced Doc_9881641_859_870_Disease.
9881641	6	872	These findings suggest that Doc_9881641_900_910_Chemical-produced Doc_9881641_920_931_Disease is partly attributable to the activation of Doc_9881641_976_989_Chemical-sensitive Doc_9881641_1000_1002_Chemical channels (Doc_9881641_1013_1014_Chemical(Doc_9881641_1015_1018_Chemical) channels), which presumably exist on arterial smooth muscle cells.
9881641	7	1087	EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor)/Doc_9881641_1130_1142_Chemical does not seem to play an important role in the peptide-produced Doc_9881641_1207_1218_Disease.
9889429	0	0	Long-term efficacy and adverse event of Doc_9889429_40_50_Chemical sustained-release tablets for Doc_9889429_81_94_Chemical-induced Doc_9889429_103_115_Disease in patients with Doc_9889429_133_142_Disease.
9889429	1	144	Thirteen Doc_9889429_153_162_Disease patients with Doc_9889429_177_189_Disease during the course of Doc_9889429_211_224_Chemical therapy were treated for 25 months with a Doc_9889429_267_274_Chemical channel blocker, sustained-release Doc_9889429_310_320_Chemical, to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both drugs.
9889429	2	422	Seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical Doc_9889429_475_487_Disease state before Doc_9889429_501_514_Chemical therapy.
9889429	3	524	Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of Doc_9889429_635_645_Chemical therapy, and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 months.
9889429	4	739	The adverse events during combined therapy with Doc_9889429_787_800_Chemical and Doc_9889429_805_815_Chemical included an increase in blood Doc_9889429_846_859_Chemical levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of Doc_9889429_910_930_Disease in 2 of the 13 patients.
9889429	5	956	Our findings indicate that sustained-release Doc_9889429_1001_1011_Chemical is useful for Doc_9889429_1026_1038_Disease Doc_9889429_1039_1048_Disease patients under long-term treatment with Doc_9889429_1089_1102_Chemical, but that these patients should be monitored for Doc_9889429_1152_1172_Disease.
