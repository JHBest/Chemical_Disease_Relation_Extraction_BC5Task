<s> Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of Doc_9862868_87_128_Disease. </s>
<s> Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. </s>
<s> Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in Doc_9862868_321_332_Disease, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. </s>
<s> Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. </s>
<s> Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. </s>
<s> We used rat models of Doc_9862868_678_702_Disease by Doc_9862868_706_723_Chemical (Doc_9862868_725_727_Chemical) treatment and Doc_9862868_743_767_Disease by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. </s>
<s> Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. </s>
<s> In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. </s>
<s> In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. </s>
<s> Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. </s>
<s> After Doc_9862868_1356_1358_Chemical treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. </s>
<s> This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and Doc_9862868_1682_1684_Chemical treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability. </s>

<s> To clarify the mechanisms of Doc_9931093_244_250_Chemical-induced Doc_9931093_259_271_Disease, we studied the chronic effects of Doc_9931093_307_313_Chemical on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial Doc_9931093_446_458_Chemical synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. </s>
