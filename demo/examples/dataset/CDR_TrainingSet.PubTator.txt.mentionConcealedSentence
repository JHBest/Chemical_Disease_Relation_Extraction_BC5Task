10091617	1	120	The United Kingdom Doc_10091617_151_170_Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Doc_10091617_247_266_Disease (Doc_10091617_268_270_Disease) randomized to receive 10 mg Doc_10091617_300_310_Chemical per day and Doc_10091617_323_329_Chemical compared with those taking Doc_10091617_357_363_Chemical alone.
10091617	2	371	Recently, we found that therapy with Doc_10091617_408_418_Chemical and Doc_10091617_423_429_Chemical was associated with selective Doc_10091617_460_492_Disease which was abolished by withdrawal of Doc_10091617_530_540_Chemical.
10091617	3	542	This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure.
10091617	4	642	The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping Doc_10091617_816_826_Chemical in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes Doc_10091617_916_939_Disease.
10091617	5	941	The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in Doc_10091617_1035_1037_Disease patients receiving Doc_10091617_1057_1067_Chemical and as the drug was withdrawn.
10091617	6	1099	Head-up tilt caused Doc_10091617_1128_1160_Disease which was marked in six of 20 Doc_10091617_1191_1193_Disease patients on Doc_10091617_1206_1216_Chemical, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures.
10091617	7	1284	A lesser degree of Doc_10091617_1303_1326_Disease occurred with standing.
10091617	8	1351	Doc_10091617_1351_1374_Disease was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of Doc_10091617_1418_1428_Chemical and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug.
10091617	9	1493	Stopping Doc_10091617_1502_1512_Chemical also significantly Doc_10091617_1532_1589_Disease consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action.
10091617	10	1654	This study confirms our previous finding that Doc_10091617_1712_1722_Chemical in combination with Doc_10091617_1743_1749_Chemical is associated with selective Doc_10091617_1779_1802_Disease.
10091617	11	1804	The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of Doc_10091617_1932_1943_Chemical and Doc_10091617_1948_1962_Chemical are discussed.

10193204	1	108	Doc_10193204_108_119_Chemical (Doc_10193204_121_124_Chemical) and Doc_10193204_130_143_Chemical (Doc_10193204_145_148_Chemical) are two naturally occurring analogues with a Doc_10193204_195_216_Chemical structure.
10193204	2	228	The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of Doc_10193204_291_294_Chemical and Doc_10193204_299_302_Chemical on the experimental Doc_10193204_323_333_Disease induced by collagen plus Doc_10193204_359_370_Chemical (Doc_10193204_372_374_Chemical) in mice, and Doc_10193204_389_409_Disease and Doc_10193204_414_431_Disease in vitro.
10193204	3	442	In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of Doc_10193204_503_506_Chemical and Doc_10193204_511_514_Chemical in mice showed the inhibition of Doc_10193204_548_558_Disease by 55% and 35%, respectively, while Doc_10193204_595_615_Chemical (Doc_10193204_617_620_Chemical, 50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition.
10193204	4	687	In the vitro human Doc_10193204_706_727_Disease induced by the agonists used in tests, Doc_10193204_767_770_Chemical and Doc_10193204_775_778_Chemical showed the inhibitions dose dependently.
10193204	5	820	In addition, neither Doc_10193204_841_844_Chemical nor Doc_10193204_849_852_Chemical showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT) using human-citrated plasma.
10193204	6	1037	These results suggest that antithrombosis of Doc_10193204_1082_1085_Chemical and Doc_10193204_1090_1093_Chemical in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities.

10669626	5	816	To directly examine the importance of growth to Doc_10669626_864_872_Chemical-induced Doc_10669626_881_901_Disease in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth.
10669626	6	1063	Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Doc_10669626_1112_1120_Chemical produced massive focal Doc_10669626_1144_1171_Disease media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable Doc_10669626_1223_1243_Disease in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group.
10669626	7	1292	Although the explanation for the association between Doc_10669626_1345_1365_Disease and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum Doc_10669626_1475_1484_Chemical and susceptibility to Doc_10669626_1507_1527_Disease, with 30% higher levels of serum Doc_10669626_1561_1570_Chemical in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Doc_10669626_1658_1666_Chemical-induced Doc_10669626_1675_1695_Disease, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats.
10669626	8	1777	This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Doc_10669626_1836_1844_Chemical-induced Doc_10669626_1853_1873_Disease could be related to higher serum Doc_10669626_1907_1916_Chemical levels.
10669626	9	1925	The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between Doc_10669626_1993_2002_Chemical and Doc_10669626_2007_2015_Chemical in Doc_10669626_2019_2039_Disease.
10669626	10	2041	High doses of Doc_10669626_2055_2064_Chemical are known to cause Doc_10669626_2084_2111_Disease media in as little as 3 to 4 days.

10669626	12	2317	In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Doc_10669626_2420_2428_Chemical administration dramatically increased the extent of Doc_10669626_2481_2494_Disease in the media of Doc_10669626_2511_2520_Chemical-treated rats at 3 and 4 days.
10669626	13	2551	There was a close parallel between the effect of Doc_10669626_2600_2609_Chemical dose on Doc_10669626_2618_2638_Disease and the effect of Doc_10669626_2657_2666_Chemical dose on the elevation of serum Doc_10669626_2698_2705_Chemical, which suggests that Doc_10669626_2727_2736_Chemical may induce Doc_10669626_2748_2768_Disease through its effect on serum Doc_10669626_2797_2804_Chemical.
10669626	14	2806	Because Doc_10669626_2814_2822_Chemical treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum Doc_10669626_2873_2880_Chemical produced by Doc_10669626_2893_2902_Chemical, the synergy between Doc_10669626_2924_2932_Chemical and Doc_10669626_2937_2946_Chemical is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Doc_10669626_2997_3005_Chemical inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a Doc_10669626_3055_3068_Disease inhibitor.
10669626	15	3080	High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of Doc_10669626_3136_3156_Disease in rats treated with Doc_10669626_3178_3187_Chemical plus Doc_10669626_3193_3201_Chemical, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not Doc_10669626_3281_3299_Chemical.
10669626	16	3301	These observations indicate that although the Doc_10669626_3347_3369_Chemical residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a Doc_10669626_3447_3460_Disease inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at Doc_10669626_3518_3531_Disease sites.

10683478	2	296	Doc_10683478_296_307_Chemical, a nonselective Doc_10683478_324_340_Chemical, was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce Doc_10683478_417_428_Disease, and to produce distinct changes to Doc_10683478_465_473_Chemical turnover in the rodent brain.
10683478	3	504	From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of Doc_10683478_583_594_Chemical-induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed.
10683478	4	677	In rats, detection of Doc_10683478_699_710_Chemical-induced Doc_10683478_719_732_Disease was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions.
10683478	5	804	Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to Doc_10683478_879_890_Chemical such as drug-induced Doc_10683478_912_923_Disease.
10683478	6	925	In mice, Doc_10683478_934_945_Chemical produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage.
10683478	7	1077	Drug-induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only, while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both.
10683478	8	1223	By contrast, Doc_10683478_1236_1247_Chemical-induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box.

10704919	6	823	The Doc_10704919_827_836_Disease effect of Doc_10704919_847_850_Chemical is prevented by low concentrations of Doc_10704919_889_905_Chemical (Doc_10704919_907_914_Chemical) and Doc_10704919_920_944_Chemical (Doc_10704919_946_955_Chemical) (inactivated functional Doc_10704919_981_989_Chemical) indicating that Doc_10704919_1007_1010_Chemical-induced Doc_10704919_1019_1028_Disease is not related to oxidative membrane damage.
10704919	7	1074	This was further evidenced by absence of Doc_10704919_1115_1121_Chemical consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with Doc_10704919_1192_1195_Chemical-induced Doc_10704919_1204_1213_Disease.
10704919	8	1215	Furthermore, it was observed that Doc_10704919_1249_1252_Chemical inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by Doc_10704919_1312_1316_Chemical, thus ruling out Doc_10704919_1334_1337_Chemical-induced cell oxidative stress.

10704919	12	1796	These effects suggest that the protection from Doc_10704919_1843_1852_Disease by Doc_10704919_1856_1867_Chemical is related to a decreased Doc_10704919_1894_1897_Chemical incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided.
10704919	13	2014	Therefore, Doc_10704919_2025_2028_Chemical-induced Doc_10704919_2037_2046_Disease results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane.
10704919	14	2239	These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by Doc_10704919_2339_2342_Chemical, resulting in Doc_10704919_2357_2373_Disease.

10739826	6	989	We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of Doc_10739826_1081_1084_Disease when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills.
10739826	7	1216	These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer Doc_10739826_1283_1285_Chemical in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use.

10807237	2	177	However, no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome.
10807237	3	306	A review of admissions during a 6-year period revealed 14 patients with Doc_10807237_387_394_Chemical-related Doc_10807237_403_412_Disease.
10807237	4	414	This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with Doc_10807237_480_498_Disease and no history of Doc_10807237_517_530_Disease.
10807237	5	532	Age at presentation, time of ictus after intoxication, Hunt and Hess grade of Doc_10807237_610_633_Disease, size of the Doc_10807237_647_655_Disease, location of the Doc_10807237_673_681_Disease, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared.
10807237	6	747	The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group (P < 0.002).
10807237	7	867	In patients in the study group, all Doc_10807237_903_912_Disease were located in the anterior circulation.
10807237	8	955	The majority of these Doc_10807237_977_986_Disease were smaller than those of the control group (8 +/- 6.08 mm versus 11 +/- 5.4 mm; P = 0.05).
10807237	9	1080	The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant.
10807237	10	1168	Hunt and Hess grade (P < 0.005) and age (P < 0.007) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with Doc_10807237_1281_1288_Chemical-related Doc_10807237_1297_1306_Disease.

10835440	0	0	Effect of intravenous Doc_10835440_22_32_Chemical on blood pressure and outcome after Doc_10835440_69_81_Disease.
10835440	1	83	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous Doc_10835440_123_133_Chemical West European Doc_10835440_148_154_Disease Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between Doc_10835440_198_208_Chemical-induced Doc_10835440_217_244_Disease (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in Doc_10835440_280_292_Disease.
10835440	2	294	We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of Doc_10835440_451_463_Disease.
10835440	3	465	Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Doc_10835440_512_527_Disease (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) Doc_10835440_621_631_Chemical (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) Doc_10835440_663_673_Chemical (n=94).
10835440	4	682	The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed.
10835440	5	788	Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively).
10835440	6	931	Doc_10835440_931_941_Chemical treatment resulted in a statistically significant Doc_10835440_992_1016_Disease (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days.
10835440	7	1109	In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between Doc_10835440_1169_1182_Disease and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048).
10835440	8	1280	Patients with a Doc_10835440_1296_1309_Disease of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable Doc_10835440_1422_1427_Disease or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and Doc_10835440_1512_1517_Disease alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively).
10835440	9	1638	There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome.
10835440	10	1695	DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose Doc_10835440_1829_1839_Chemical after Doc_10835440_1846_1858_Disease.
10835440	11	1860	For low-dose Doc_10835440_1873_1883_Chemical, the results were not conclusive.
10835440	12	1918	These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of Doc_10835440_1988_1998_Chemical.

10901305	0	0	Doc_10901305_0_8_Chemical sedation for the reduction of children's Doc_10901305_50_59_Disease in the emergency department.
10901305	1	89	There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of Doc_10901305_160_168_Chemical, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation.
10901305	2	247	The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of Doc_10901305_322_330_Chemical for sedation in the treatment of children's Doc_10901305_375_384_Disease in the emergency department.
10901305	3	414	One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated Doc_10901305_578_586_Disease or Doc_10901305_590_601_Disease in the emergency department at a level-I Doc_10901305_643_649_Disease center were prospectively evaluated.
10901305	4	687	Doc_10901305_687_709_Chemical was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen.
10901305	5	931	A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse.
10901305	6	1098	Any Doc_10901305_1102_1106_Disease during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Doc_10901305_1242_1246_Disease Scale (CHEOPS).
10901305	7	1263	The average time from intravenous administration of Doc_10901305_1324_1332_Chemical to manipulation of the Doc_10901305_1356_1364_Disease or Doc_10901305_1368_1379_Disease was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes).
10901305	8	1612	The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Doc_10901305_1686_1690_Disease Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no Doc_10901305_1762_1766_Disease during Doc_10901305_1774_1782_Disease reduction.
10901305	9	1794	Adequate Doc_10901305_1803_1811_Disease reduction was obtained in 111 of the children.
10901305	10	1859	Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation.
10901305	11	2039	Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients.
10901305	12	2129	Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable.
10901305	13	2176	Minor side effects included Doc_10901305_2204_2210_Disease (thirteen patients), Doc_10901305_2232_2238_Disease (eight of the thirteen patients with Doc_10901305_2276_2282_Disease), Doc_10901305_2285_2295_Disease (evident as Doc_10901305_2308_2324_Disease in ten patients), and Doc_10901305_2347_2365_Disease (one patient).
10901305	14	2381	No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had Doc_10901305_2435_2449_Disease or nightmares.
10901305	15	2465	Doc_10901305_2478_2486_Chemical reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's Doc_10901305_2598_2607_Disease in the emergency department at our institution.
10901305	16	2656	Doc_10901305_2656_2664_Chemical should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.

11027905	5	991	Doc_11027905_991_999_Chemical, but not saline solution, significantly reduced the Doc_11027905_1052_1056_Disease intensity in almost all the patients at both doses.
11027905	6	1109	This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses.
11027905	7	1178	Doc_11027905_1178_1192_Disease occurred in 4 patients, and an unpleasant sensation ("empty head") was also reported by 2 patients.
11027905	8	1293	These episodes reversed after the administration of Doc_11027905_1345_1353_Chemical 1 mg intravenously.
11027905	9	1374	Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with Doc_11027905_1449_1457_Chemical in both groups and were more marked with Doc_11027905_1499_1507_Chemical 0.50 mg/kg.
11027905	10	1520	A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T30 in patients who received 0.50 mg/kg of Doc_11027905_1612_1620_Chemical.

11334364	4	784	For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg Doc_11334364_852_856_Chemical for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (Doc_11334364_930_933_Chemical: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; Doc_11334364_955_958_Chemical: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; Doc_11334364_988_991_Chemical: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h).
11334364	5	1013	Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues.
11334364	6	1281	Results indicate that Doc_11334364_1303_1307_Chemical preexposure prior to Doc_11334364_1329_1332_Chemical, Doc_11334364_1334_1337_Chemical and Doc_11334364_1342_1345_Chemical, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation.
11334364	7	1482	Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive Doc_11334364_1576_1589_Disease with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of Doc_11334364_1675_1679_Chemical preexposure than in its presence.
11334364	8	1714	Doc_11334364_1714_1718_Chemical+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery.
11334364	9	1796	Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation.
11334364	10	1916	Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, Doc_11334364_1955_1958_Chemical, Doc_11334364_1960_1963_Chemical and Doc_11334364_1968_1971_Chemical induced apoptotic death in addition to Doc_11334364_2011_2019_Disease in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by Doc_11334364_2083_2087_Chemical.
11334364	11	2089	Since Doc_11334364_2095_2098_Chemical, Doc_11334364_2100_2103_Chemical and Doc_11334364_2108_2111_Chemical undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by Doc_11334364_2208_2212_Chemical may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals.
11334364	12	2305	In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process.
11334364	13	2447	Additionally, this may have been the first report on Doc_11334364_2500_2503_Chemical-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue.
11334364	14	2548	Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish Doc_11334364_2599_2603_Chemical's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.

11379838	1	82	Concerns about possible risks of switching to Doc_11379838_140_145_Disease associated with Doc_11379838_162_177_Chemical continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for Doc_11379838_260_278_Disease.
11379838	2	280	The response of 44 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for Doc_11379838_344_360_Disease to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech-Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale.
11379838	3	516	Patients who experienced a Doc_11379838_543_548_Disease or Doc_11379838_552_561_Disease switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (Doc_11379838_658_674_Disease vs. Doc_11379838_679_689_Disease), number of previous Doc_11379838_711_716_Disease episodes, type of Doc_11379838_735_749_Chemical therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. Doc_11379838_794_808_Chemical drugs and, more particularly, selective Doc_11379838_849_878_Chemical [Doc_11379838_880_885_Chemical]), use and type of mood stabilizers (Doc_11379838_923_930_Chemical vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview.
11379838	4	1110	Switches to Doc_11379838_1131_1140_Disease or Doc_11379838_1144_1149_Disease occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with Doc_11379838_1244_1249_Chemical [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced Doc_11379838_1283_1288_Disease episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced Doc_11379838_1327_1336_Disease episodes.
11379838	5	1347	Sex, age, diagnosis (Doc_11379838_1368_1377_Disease vs. Doc_11379838_1382_1392_Disease), and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching.
11379838	6	1458	The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer.
11379838	7	1595	In contrast, mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving Doc_11379838_1663_1670_Chemical (15%, 4/26) than in patients not treated with Doc_11379838_1717_1724_Chemical (44%, 8/18; p = .04).
11379838	8	1747	The number of previous Doc_11379838_1770_1775_Disease episodes did not affect the probability of switching, whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching (p = .008).
11379838	9	1994	The frequency of mood switching associated with acute Doc_11379838_2060_2074_Chemical therapy may be reduced by Doc_11379838_2101_2108_Chemical treatment.
11379838	10	2120	Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament, who have a greater risk of mood switches.
11391224	0	0	Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native Doc_11391224_79_93_Disease: a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens.
11391224	1	157	An association has been found between Doc_11391224_207_232_Disease (Doc_11391224_234_236_Disease) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes (PTCR).
11391224	2	308	Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance, only one prospective study has tried to confirm it.
11391224	3	433	We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens (from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR.
11391224	4	570	In addition to renal allografts with Doc_11391224_607_609_Disease, we also examined grafts with acute rejection, recurrent Doc_11391224_667_685_Disease, Doc_11391224_687_716_Disease and stable grafts ("protocol biopsies").
11391224	5	758	Native kidney specimens included a wide range of Doc_11391224_807_823_Disease as well as cases of Doc_11391224_844_870_Disease, Doc_11391224_872_894_Disease, acute Doc_11391224_902_924_Disease, and Doc_11391224_930_952_Disease.
11391224	6	954	We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of Doc_11391224_998_1000_Disease, in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without Doc_11391224_1043_1045_Disease, and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens.
11391224	7	1096	These 13 included cases of Doc_11391224_1123_1145_Disease, Doc_11391224_1147_1173_Disease, Doc_11391224_1175_1190_Disease, Doc_11391224_1192_1218_Disease, crescentic Doc_11391224_1231_1249_Disease, and Doc_11391224_1255_1262_Chemical-related Doc_11391224_1271_1290_Disease.
11391224	8	1292	Mild PTCR in allografts without Doc_11391224_1324_1326_Disease did not predict Doc_11391224_1343_1356_Disease or significant Doc_11391224_1372_1383_Disease after follow-up periods of between 3 months and 1 year.
11391224	9	1440	We conclude that in transplants, there is a strong association between well-developed PTCR and Doc_11391224_1548_1550_Disease, while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of Doc_11391224_1631_1633_Disease is unclear.
11391224	10	1646	PTCR also occurs in certain native Doc_11391224_1681_1696_Disease, though the association is not as strong as that for Doc_11391224_1750_1752_Disease.
11391224	11	1754	We suggest that repeated Doc_11391224_1779_1797_Disease, including Doc_11391224_1809_1827_Disease, may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys.

11426838	0	0	Conformationally restricted analogs of Doc_11426838_39_45_Chemical and an antisense Doc_11426838_63_83_Chemical targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti-Doc_11426838_124_131_Chemical effects in mice.
11426838	1	149	Doc_11426838_149_156_Chemical's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects.
11426838	2	269	Therefore, three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice: Doc_11426838_378_384_Chemical (Doc_11426838_386_450_Chemical), Doc_11426838_453_459_Chemical (Doc_11426838_461_511_Chemical), and Doc_11426838_518_523_Chemical (1R,2S-(+)-cis-N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine).
11426838	3	607	Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma1 receptors.
11426838	4	715	The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for Doc_11426838_819_827_Chemical, opioid, Doc_11426838_837_841_Chemical(A) and Doc_11426838_849_853_Chemical receptors.
11426838	5	865	In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with Doc_11426838_915_921_Chemical, Doc_11426838_923_929_Chemical, or Doc_11426838_934_939_Chemical significantly attenuated Doc_11426838_965_972_Chemical-induced Doc_11426838_981_992_Disease and lethality.
11426838	6	1008	Moreover, post-treatment with Doc_11426838_1038_1043_Chemical prevented Doc_11426838_1054_1061_Chemical-induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals.
11426838	7	1120	In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist Doc_11426838_1234_1253_Chemical (Doc_11426838_1255_1258_Chemical) and the novel sigma receptor agonist Doc_11426838_1297_1303_Chemical (Doc_11426838_1305_1369_Chemical) each worsened the behavioral Doc_11426838_1400_1408_Disease of Doc_11426838_1412_1419_Chemical.
11426838	8	1421	At doses where alone, they produced no significant effects on locomotion, Doc_11426838_1495_1501_Chemical, Doc_11426838_1503_1509_Chemical and Doc_11426838_1514_1519_Chemical significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of Doc_11426838_1582_1589_Chemical.
11426838	9	1591	To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-Doc_11426838_1640_1647_Chemical effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense Doc_11426838_1730_1750_Chemical against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the Doc_11426838_1822_1832_Disease and locomotor stimulatory effects of Doc_11426838_1870_1877_Chemical.
11426838	10	1879	Together, the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of Doc_11426838_1991_1998_Chemical-induced behaviors.

11569530	2	320	Doc_11569530_320_323_Disease is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. Doc_11569530_407_418_Chemical and Doc_11569530_423_433_Chemical). 2.
11569530	3	439	The potential of compounds to cause Doc_11569530_475_478_Disease was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog.
11569530	4	537	Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause Doc_11569530_592_595_Disease were investigated: Doc_11569530_615_626_Chemical, Doc_11569530_628_638_Chemical, Doc_11569530_640_649_Chemical and Doc_11569530_654_659_Chemical.

11569530	6	854	Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target-free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds. 3.
11569530	7	1089	These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for Doc_11569530_1142_1153_Chemical (1.9 nM), Doc_11569530_1164_1174_Chemical (76 nM), Doc_11569530_1184_1193_Chemical (11 nM) and Doc_11569530_1206_1211_Chemical (1.9 nM) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects.

11807648	5	490	We wanted to study whether Doc_11807648_517_522_Chemical retains its Doc_11807648_535_545_Disease action if incorporated into a FS.
11807648	6	580	FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of Doc_11807648_643_648_Chemical (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats.
11807648	7	736	The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia.
11807648	8	892	FS containing Doc_11807648_916_921_Chemical caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct Doc_11807648_990_1000_Disease behaviours.
11807648	9	1013	The degree of these Doc_11807648_1033_1041_Disease increased with increasing concentration of Doc_11807648_1085_1090_Chemical.
11807648	10	1092	Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml Doc_11807648_1123_1128_Chemical evoked Doc_11807648_1136_1156_Disease in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of Doc_11807648_1216_1221_Chemical (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated Doc_11807648_1280_1290_Disease potentials in 1 of 6 rats.
11807648	11	1318	In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity.
11807648	12	1394	Doc_11807648_1410_1425_Chemical retains its Doc_11807648_1438_1448_Disease action within FS.
11807648	13	1467	Thus, use of FS containing Doc_11807648_1494_1499_Chemical for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.
11875660	0	0	Sequential observations of Doc_11875660_27_38_Disease and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system: analysis of the mechanism of transformation from Doc_11875660_164_175_Disease to Doc_11875660_179_190_Disease.
11875660	1	192	Doc_11875660_192_203_Disease has been suggested to develop from Doc_11875660_239_250_Disease; however, there is little direct experimental evidence to support this, and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear.
11875660	2	376	We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid- to late-gestation mouse embryos.
11875660	3	527	We observed the Doc_11875660_543_554_Disease induced by Doc_11875660_566_579_Chemical at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), let the embryos develop exo utero until E18.5, and re-observed the same embryos at E18.5.
11875660	4	701	We confirmed several cases of transformation from Doc_11875660_751_762_Disease to Doc_11875660_766_777_Disease.
11875660	5	779	However, in many cases, the Doc_11875660_807_819_Disease brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period.
11875660	6	895	To analyze the transformation patterns, we classified the Doc_11875660_953_964_Disease by size and shape of the Doc_11875660_990_1002_Disease tissue into several types at E13.5 and E18.5.
11875660	7	1049	It was found that the transformation of Doc_11875660_1089_1101_Disease tissue was not simply size-dependent, and all cases of Doc_11875660_1157_1168_Disease at E18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of Doc_11875660_1223_1235_Disease tissue at E13.5.
11875660	8	1253	Microscopic observation showed the configuration of Doc_11875660_1305_1316_Disease at E13.5, frequent Doc_11875660_1336_1348_Disease and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the Doc_11875660_1413_1425_Disease head at E15.5, and multiple modes of reduction in the Doc_11875660_1480_1492_Disease tissue at E18.5.
11875660	9	1510	From observations of the vasculature, altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the Doc_11875660_1612_1624_Disease head.
11875660	10	1631	These findings suggest that overgrowth of the Doc_11875660_1677_1689_Disease neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels, subsequent peripheral Doc_11875660_1779_1798_Disease and/or Doc_11875660_1806_1818_Disease in various parts of the Doc_11875660_1843_1855_Disease head, leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from Doc_11875660_1939_1950_Disease to Doc_11875660_1954_1965_Disease.

Doc_11897407_452_467_Chemical was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with Doc_11897407_560_573_Chemical-induced acute Doc_11897407_588_609_Disease.
11897407	4	611	Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an Doc_11897407_672_679_Disease 18 h after Doc_11897407_691_704_Chemical administration.
11897407	5	721	The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys.
11897407	6	801	Thirty minutes after Doc_11897407_822_837_Chemical administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats.
11897407	7	972	ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4.
11897407	8	1035	The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early Doc_11897407_1196_1214_Disease.

11928786	5	490	Two patients developed severe Doc_11928786_520_539_Disease, including one patient who was resuscitated following a Doc_11928786_596_610_Disease.
11928786	6	612	All patients recovered without sequelae.
11928786	7	653	We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy, following ingestion of 13.5g Doc_11928786_818_827_Chemical.
11928786	8	829	Recurrent Doc_11928786_839_847_Disease were treated with Doc_11928786_866_874_Chemical and broad complex Doc_11928786_893_904_Disease was successfully treated with Doc_11928786_935_944_Chemical.

11961407	0	0	GLEPP1 receptor Doc_11961407_16_24_Chemical phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat Doc_11961407_52_55_Chemical Doc_11961407_56_65_Disease.
11961407	1	67	A marker of acute podocyte injury.
11961407	2	102	Glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein Doc_11961407_183_191_Chemical phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes.
11961407	3	299	This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process.
11961407	4	393	To better understand the utility of GLEPP1 as a marker of Doc_11961407_451_468_Disease, the amount and distribution of GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat.
11961407	5	646	Doc_11961407_646_671_Chemical Doc_11961407_672_681_Disease was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of Doc_11961407_733_758_Chemical (Doc_11961407_760_763_Chemical, 20 mg/100g BW).
11961407	6	781	Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after Doc_11961407_849_852_Chemical injection so as to include both the acute phase of Doc_11961407_904_915_Disease associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of Doc_11961407_993_1004_Disease associated with Doc_11961407_1021_1039_Disease (days 45-126).
11961407	7	1055	At day 5, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range (265.2 +/- 79.6 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus and 100%) to 15% of normal (41.8 +/- 4.8 x 10(6) moles/glomerulus, p < 0.005).
11961407	8	1244	This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 +/- 1 to 99.0 +/- 61 mg/day (p < 0.001).
11961407	9	1367	In contrast, podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time.
11961407	10	1435	By day 11, GLEPP1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline.
11961407	11	1508	By day 45-126, at a time when glomerular scarring was present, GLEPP1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP1 was not different from normal.
11961407	12	1698	We conclude that GLEPP1 expression, unlike podocalyxin, reflects podocyte injury induced by Doc_11961407_1790_1793_Chemical.
11961407	13	1795	GLEPP1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury.

12063090	1	93	This work evaluates the antinociceptive and Doc_12063090_137_149_Disease effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. Doc_12063090_195_203_Chemical with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. Doc_12063090_226_235_Chemical in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats.
12063090	2	302	On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, Doc_12063090_400_404_Disease-induced functional impairment model, and the Doc_12063090_450_458_Chemical meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit.
12063090	3	514	Simultaneous administration of Doc_12063090_545_553_Chemical with Doc_12063090_559_568_Chemical resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single (298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area (ua); P<0.001) and repeated administration (280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22 ua; P<0.001).
12063090	4	793	Antinociceptive effect of Doc_12063090_819_827_Chemical was reduced in chronically treated rats (39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au) while the combination-induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment (298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au).
12063090	5	1008	Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg/kg Doc_12063090_1095_1103_Chemical s.c. (P<0.05), suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed.
12063090	6	1207	In independent groups, Doc_12063090_1230_1238_Chemical inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the Doc_12063090_1393_1405_Disease effects.
12063090	7	1415	The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by Doc_12063090_1488_1496_Chemical regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that Doc_12063090_1550_1559_Chemical did not potentiate Doc_12063090_1579_1587_Chemical-induced Doc_12063090_1596_1608_Disease.
12063090	8	1610	These findings show a significant interaction between Doc_12063090_1664_1672_Chemical and Doc_12063090_1677_1686_Chemical in chronically treated rats, suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of Doc_12063090_1786_1798_Disease.

12090760	2	305	Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in Doc_12090760_472_475_Chemical-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone.
12090760	3	622	We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells.
12090760	4	749	Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3.
12090760	5	887	There was a significant reduction of Doc_12090760_924_933_Chemical incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO.
12090760	6	1037	Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced Doc_12090760_1187_1196_Chemical incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone.
12090760	7	1325	These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.

12584269	10	1769	The morphological changes presented a similar pattern.
12584269	11	1824	The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with Doc_12584269_1904_1907_Chemical plus Doc_12584269_1913_1916_Chemical (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of Doc_12584269_1989_1997_Disease also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02).

12589964	3	666	Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg Doc_12589964_720_723_Chemical, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW.
12589964	4	800	Ten rats received saline as a control group.
12589964	5	845	cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK.
12589964	6	965	By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before Doc_12589964_1125_1128_Chemical or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats.
12589964	7	1200	Histology was performed in Doc_12589964_1227_1230_Chemical-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last Doc_12589964_1268_1271_Chemical dose and in all controls.

12589964	9	1395	End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the Doc_12589964_1526_1529_Chemical group (p<0.001).
12589964	10	1547	These parameters remained unchanged in controls.
12589964	11	1596	Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given Doc_12589964_1650_1653_Chemical revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial Doc_12589964_1723_1731_Disease.
12589964	12	1733	In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found.
12589964	13	1805	Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular Doc_12589964_1878_1886_Disease.
12589964	14	1888	A significant rise in cTnT was found in Doc_12589964_1928_1931_Chemical rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05).
12589964	15	2018	cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg Doc_12589964_2111_2114_Chemical.

12653683	10	1265	Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high Doc_12653683_1388_1399_Chemical concentrations, and was followed by a return of Doc_12653683_1448_1454_Chemical excretion to control values.
12653683	11	1484	The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during Doc_12653683_1568_1571_Chemical-induced Doc_12653683_1580_1586_Chemical retention.
12653683	12	1598	In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of Doc_12653683_1723_1726_Chemical-induced Doc_12653683_1735_1753_Disease in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by Doc_12653683_1808_1819_Chemical after day 3.

12921865	5	1065	Kindled Doc_12921865_1073_1081_Disease were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg Doc_12921865_1131_1138_Chemical for 5 days.
12921865	6	1151	All of these positive Doc_12921865_1173_1177_Chemical(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled Doc_12921865_1229_1237_Disease, whereas only Doc_12921865_1252_1268_Chemical and Doc_12921865_1273_1283_Chemical inhibited the development of kindling.
12921865	7	1323	Doc_12921865_1323_1339_Chemical and Doc_12921865_1344_1356_Chemical, but not Doc_12921865_1366_1376_Chemical, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling.

137340	1	89	The effect of humoral modulators on the Doc_137340_129_137_Chemical-induced Doc_137340_146_176_Disease of mice was studied.
137340	2	198	The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of Doc_137340_245_253_Chemical-HC1 produced a marked Doc_137340_276_306_Disease in mice.
137340	3	316	The Doc_137340_320_328_Chemical-induced Doc_137340_337_350_Disease was potentiated by Doc_137340_370_381_Chemical and attenuated by Doc_137340_400_413_Chemical.
137340	4	415	In contrast, both Doc_137340_433_448_Chemical and Doc_137340_453_464_Chemical, which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the Doc_137340_535_548_Disease produced by Doc_137340_561_569_Chemical.
137340	5	571	Pretreatment of mice with Doc_137340_597_617_Chemical (20 mg/kg i.p., one hour), an inhibitor of Doc_137340_661_669_Chemical hydroxylase, significantly decreased the activity-increasing effects of Doc_137340_742_750_Chemical.
137340	6	752	On the other hand, pretreatment with Doc_137340_789_810_Chemical (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a Doc_137340_842_851_Chemical depletor, caused no significant change in the Doc_137340_898_911_Disease.
137340	7	913	The study suggests that the activity-increasing effects of Doc_137340_972_980_Chemical are mediated by the release of Doc_137340_1012_1026_Chemical from adrenergic neurons in the brain.
137340	8	1065	And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that Doc_137340_1121_1129_Chemical acts by retarding the release of Doc_137340_1163_1176_Chemical at some central cholinergic synapses.
137340	9	1215	It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity-increasing effects of Doc_137340_1300_1308_Chemical in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity-increasing effects of Doc_137340_1414_1422_Chemical in rats.

1378968	1	101	Rats with Doc_1378968_111_118_Chemical-induced Doc_1378968_127_138_Disease were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of Doc_1378968_309_322_Disease.
1378968	2	324	Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a Doc_1378968_362_369_Chemical-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks.
1378968	3	502	Corresponding non-Doc_1378968_520_527_Chemical pretreated groups were generated.
1378968	4	562	When comparing all Doc_1378968_581_588_Chemical treated versus non-Doc_1378968_608_615_Chemical-treated groups, Doc_1378968_632_639_Chemical caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or Doc_1378968_820_827_Chemical clearance.
1378968	5	839	Consequently, Doc_1378968_853_860_Chemical pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Doc_1378968_941_943_Chemical excretion.
1378968	6	955	Doc_1378968_955_962_Chemical also caused Doc_1378968_975_986_Disease and systolic Doc_1378968_1000_1012_Disease in absence of Doc_1378968_1027_1045_Disease.
1378968	7	1047	HP failed to accentuante progression of Doc_1378968_1087_1100_Disease and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma Doc_1378968_1156_1166_Chemical levels in Doc_1378968_1177_1184_Chemical pretreated rats.
1378968	8	1202	NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP.
1378968	9	1284	NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Doc_1378968_1333_1335_Chemical-pretreated rats.
1378968	10	1353	The results indicate that Doc_1378968_1379_1381_Chemical-induced Doc_1378968_1390_1401_Disease, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with Doc_1378968_1466_1477_Disease and arterial systolic Doc_1378968_1500_1512_Disease.
1378968	11	1514	In this model of Doc_1378968_1531_1552_Disease the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli.

1420741	1	120	Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of Doc_1420741_217_228_Chemical.
1420741	2	230	Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Doc_1420741_292_307_Disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of Doc_1420741_391_403_Chemical treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients.
1420741	3	461	Eight Doc_1420741_467_482_Disease patients were included.
1420741	4	507	Doc_1420741_507_519_Chemical was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks.
1420741	5	618	The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score.
1420741	6	702	Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during Doc_1420741_743_755_Chemical treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks.
1420741	7	806	There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of Doc_1420741_910_916_Disease.
1420741	8	918	Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment.
1420741	9	1093	All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment.
1420741	10	1160	The results of this pilot study suggest that Doc_1420741_1205_1217_Chemical may be of benefit in selected chronic active Doc_1420741_1263_1278_Disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective.
1420741	11	1335	Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of Doc_1420741_1402_1414_Chemical at the cytokine level in Doc_1420741_1440_1466_Disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.

1428568	4	511	During the six-month follow up, Doc_1428568_543_553_Disease was quantified through the Beck and Zung-Conde scales every two months.
1428568	5	626	In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under Doc_1428568_700_707_Chemical treatment presented higher Doc_1428568_735_745_Disease values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control).
1428568	6	829	These results suggest that Doc_1428568_856_865_Chemical could be less of a Doc_1428568_885_895_Disease-inducer than Doc_1428568_909_916_Chemical in predisposed patients.

14659530	1	165	The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma Doc_14659530_235_266_Chemical (Doc_14659530_268_272_Chemical) concentration and platelet Doc_14659530_301_310_Chemical (Doc_14659530_312_331_Chemical, Doc_14659530_333_337_Chemical) content during the immediate Doc_14659530_368_376_Disease and the delayed genuine Doc_14659530_401_409_Disease attack provoked by Doc_14659530_429_442_Chemical.
14659530	2	444	Fifteen female Doc_14659530_459_485_Disease and eight controls participated in the study.
14659530	3	532	Sublingual Doc_14659530_543_556_Chemical (0.5 mg) was administered.
14659530	4	584	Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the Doc_14659530_670_683_Chemical application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the Doc_14659530_743_751_Disease attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects).
14659530	5	796	In those subjects who had no Doc_14659530_825_833_Disease attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used.
14659530	6	889	Plasma Doc_14659530_896_900_Chemical concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the Doc_14659530_959_967_Disease attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the Doc_14659530_1027_1035_Disease.

14659530	8	1157	However, plasma Doc_14659530_1173_1177_Chemical concentrations failed to change during immediate Doc_14659530_1227_1235_Disease and in the subjects with no Doc_14659530_1264_1272_Disease attack.
14659530	9	1281	Basal Doc_14659530_1287_1291_Chemical concentration was significantly higher and platelet Doc_14659530_1344_1348_Chemical content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a Doc_14659530_1406_1414_Disease attack.
14659530	10	1423	Platelet Doc_14659530_1432_1441_Chemical content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after Doc_14659530_1489_1502_Chemical in subjects with no Doc_14659530_1523_1531_Disease attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with Doc_14659530_1594_1602_Disease attack.
14659530	11	1611	In conclusion, the fact that plasma Doc_14659530_1647_1651_Chemical concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a Doc_14659530_1711_1719_Disease Doc_14659530_1720_1728_Disease suggests a direct relationship between Doc_14659530_1768_1772_Chemical and Doc_14659530_1777_1785_Disease.

14976857	1	119	In this report we describe the case of a 37-year-old white woman with Doc_14976857_189_206_Disease, who developed a rare syndrome called Doc_14976857_245_266_Disease, characterized by massive right-to-left interatrial shunting with transient profound Doc_14976857_352_359_Disease and Doc_14976857_364_372_Disease.
14976857	2	374	This shunt of blood via a Doc_14976857_400_420_Disease occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a Doc_14976857_520_531_Chemical Doc_14976857_532_540_Disease.
14976857	3	542	This drug caused Doc_14976857_559_584_Disease, due to its negative inotropic effect, and Doc_14976857_628_639_Disease, due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect.
14976857	4	684	These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right-to-left shunting.
14976857	5	885	In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography.

15009014	2	322	Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions.
15009014	3	431	An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa.
15009014	4	597	Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry.
15009014	5	723	Doc_15009014_723_732_Chemical (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced Doc_15009014_785_827_Disease and provoked lacrimation.
15009014	6	854	These responses were blocked by systemic pre-administration of Doc_15009014_917_939_Chemical (20 mg/kg).
15009014	7	952	The evoked Doc_15009014_963_992_Disease were also abolished by topical pre-administration of Doc_15009014_1046_1054_Chemical (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater.
15009014	8	1192	We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino-parasympathetic reflex.
15009014	9	1336	The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of Doc_15009014_1399_1412_Chemical and VIP within the meninges.

15145918	3	458	Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of Doc_15145918_514_525_Chemical (600 microg/kg) or Doc_15145918_545_561_Chemical (100 mg/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk Doc_15145918_822_830_Chemical replacement.
15145918	4	844	Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability.
15145918	5	1184	In sham-operated rats, Doc_15145918_1207_1218_Chemical or Doc_15145918_1222_1238_Chemical elicited similar Doc_15145918_1256_1267_Disease that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure.

15145918	9	1680	Estrogen replacement (Doc_15145918_1702_1718_Chemical subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of Doc_15145918_1826_1842_Chemical to sham-operated levels.
15145918	10	1868	These findings suggest that Doc_15145918_1896_1904_Chemical downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated Doc_15145918_1956_1967_Disease and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in Doc_15145918_2026_2042_Chemical-Doc_15145918_2043_2051_Chemical interaction.

1527456	3	363	Fifty-two patients suffering from intractable Doc_1527456_409_417_Disease entered this therapeutic trial, but only nine finished all five courses.
1527456	4	491	In one patient, the Doc_1527456_511_519_Disease was almost completely abolished, but in all the nine patients the decompensated Doc_1527456_600_608_Disease changed to a compensated one.

15275829	2	326	nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits.
15275829	3	406	A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors.

15275829	5	887	Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to Doc_15275829_1218_1226_Chemical-induced Doc_15275829_1235_1243_Disease when compared to wild-type littermates.
15275829	6	1284	mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains.
15275829	7	1371	Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of Doc_15275829_1459_1467_Chemical-induced Doc_15275829_1476_1484_Disease and Doc_15275829_1489_1503_Disease.

1549199	3	467	Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a Doc_1549199_627_635_Chemical agonist.
1549199	4	645	Other possible adverse effects--such as Doc_1549199_685_711_Disease, Doc_1549199_713_736_Disease, Doc_1549199_738_746_Chemical-induced Doc_1549199_755_764_Disease, Doc_1549199_766_784_Disease or Doc_1549199_788_799_Disease, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment.
1549199	5	878	Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the Doc_1549199_917_936_Disease patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning, including daily exercise, physical therapy, and involvement with support groups.
15515654	0	0	Long term audiological evaluation of Doc_15515654_37_53_Disease patients.
15515654	1	64	The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of Doc_15515654_167_179_Disease in children and young adults with Doc_15515654_214_230_Disease major.
15515654	2	238	One hundred and four (104) patients aged 6-35 years (mean 17,2 years) participated in the study.
15515654	3	344	All patients were on a regular transfusion-chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9.5 gr/dl.
15515654	4	455	Subjects were receiving Doc_15515654_479_494_Chemical (Doc_15515654_496_499_Chemical) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50-60 mg/kg, 5-6 days a week during the first six years of the study, which was then reduced to 40-50 mg/kg for the following eight years.
15515654	5	686	Patients were followed for 8-14 years.
15515654	6	725	Overall, 21 out of 104 patients (20.2%) presented with high frequency Doc_15515654_804_830_Disease (Doc_15515654_832_836_Disease), either unilateral or bilateral.
15515654	7	871	No Doc_15515654_874_882_Disease factor, other than Doc_15515654_902_905_Chemical, was present in any of the patients.
15515654	8	943	Patients with Doc_15515654_957_961_Disease presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing, however, no statistically significant difference was observed.
15515654	9	1111	Subjects with Doc_15515654_1125_1129_Disease were submitted to Doc_15515654_1148_1151_Chemical reduction or temporary withdrawal.
15515654	10	1187	Following intervention, 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered, 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation.
15515654	11	1303	The findings are indicative of Doc_15515654_1346_1349_Chemical's contributing role in the development of Doc_15515654_1392_1410_Disease.
15515654	12	1412	Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all Doc_15515654_1463_1474_Disease patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse Doc_15515654_1597_1615_Disease.

15572383	1	120	In man, differences in Doc_15572383_155_166_Chemical-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis.
15572383	2	267	This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage.
15572383	3	402	Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of Doc_15572383_488_500_Disease induced by a single injection of Doc_15572383_534_544_Chemical in rats.
15572383	4	554	Renal ACE activity (Doc_15572383_583_594_Chemical cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats.

15572383	9	1065	Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in Doc_15572383_1132_1143_Disease after Doc_15572383_1150_1160_Chemical (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05).
15572383	10	1441	Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with Doc_15572383_1483_1507_Disease (r = 0.22, NS).
15572383	11	1524	In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed.

15602202	2	163	The second episode was more severe than the first; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy, renal function remained impaired.
15602202	3	318	Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute Doc_15602202_366_388_Disease are benign and self-limited, some patients are at risk for permanent Doc_15602202_458_470_Disease.

15632880	6	923	Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared.
15632880	7	1038	Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of Doc_15632880_1110_1124_Chemical due to Doc_15632880_1132_1144_Disease (n = 33) or Doc_15632880_1157_1170_Disease (n = 34).
15632880	8	1181	Patients who developed Doc_15632880_1204_1216_Disease were older and more likely to have Doc_15632880_1252_1260_Disease, had higher baseline serum Doc_15632880_1288_1297_Chemical levels and lower baseline Doc_15632880_1324_1333_Chemical supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134).
15632880	9	1431	Patients who developed Doc_15632880_1454_1473_Disease had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum Doc_15632880_1531_1541_Chemical, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with Doc_15632880_1624_1632_Chemical diuretics than controls.

15649445	3	469	Doc_15649445_469_478_Chemical injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control.
15649445	4	670	Doc_15649445_670_681_Chemical administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations.
15649445	5	876	After the treatments and behavioral observation, Doc_15649445_925_934_Chemical uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed.
15649445	6	981	A decreased Doc_15649445_993_1002_Chemical uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with Doc_15649445_1072_1081_Chemical and Doc_15649445_1086_1097_Chemical, compared to the control.
15649445	7	1124	Importantly, a decrease in Doc_15649445_1151_1160_Chemical uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of Doc_15649445_1227_1247_Disease.

15859940	3	306	We aimed to determine the causes of Doc_15859940_342_368_Disease in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature.
15859940	4	449	MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of Doc_15859940_502_528_Disease during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval.
15859940	5	739	Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible.
15859940	6	801	Five cases of Doc_15859940_824_850_Disease were found.
15859940	7	863	Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up.
15859940	8	1067	Three cases were related to Doc_15859940_1095_1107_Chemical, and 1 case was secondary to both Doc_15859940_1142_1154_Chemical and Doc_15859940_1159_1169_Chemical.
15859940	9	1171	The fifth case had features of Doc_15859940_1202_1228_Disease related to an Doc_15859940_1243_1268_Disease in a patient with Doc_15859940_1287_1315_Disease.
15859940	10	1317	In the literature, the most-frequent cause of Doc_15859940_1376_1401_Disease in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the Doc_15859940_1467_1492_Disease.
15859940	11	1494	Other causes include drug-related (Doc_15859940_1529_1541_Chemical, Doc_15859940_1543_1553_Chemical) Doc_15859940_1555_1563_Disease, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection.
15859940	12	1619	We found that the most-frequent cause of Doc_15859940_1660_1686_Disease was drug related, secondary mainly to Doc_15859940_1725_1737_Chemical.

16160878	3	290	However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered Doc_16160878_348_352_Chemical have received little attention.
16160878	4	385	In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of Doc_16160878_453_457_Chemical on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice.
16160878	5	517	Administration of graded doses of Doc_16160878_551_555_Chemical (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test.
16160878	6	994	Intracerebroventricular injection of Doc_16160878_1031_1035_Chemical also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse.
16160878	7	1223	Whatever was the dose, the central administration of Doc_16160878_1276_1280_Chemical had no effect on body temperature, nociception, Doc_16160878_1329_1340_Chemical-induced Doc_16160878_1349_1364_Disease and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma Doc_16160878_1414_1428_Chemical level.
16160878	8	1436	Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of Doc_16160878_1513_1517_Chemical at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse.
16160878	9	1606	These data suggest that Doc_16160878_1630_1634_Chemical may be involved in some aspects of Doc_16160878_1670_1691_Disease.

16330293	12	1577	The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively).
16330293	13	1815	Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum.
16330293	14	2015	The most common adverse events were Doc_16330293_2051_2057_Disease (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), Doc_16330293_2098_2105_Disease (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and Doc_16330293_2148_2156_Disease (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6).
16330293	15	2195	Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups.
16330293	16	2280	Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study.
16330293	17	2431	The majority of patients (>60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline.
16330293	18	2524	The 4-mg Doc_16330293_2545_2553_Chemical lozenge and 4-mg Doc_16330293_2571_2579_Chemical gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label-restricted medical conditions.

16330766	1	116	Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system (central sensitization) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced Doc_16330766_259_263_Disease sensitivity in the skin surrounding Doc_16330766_300_313_Disease (Doc_16330766_315_337_Disease).
16330766	2	340	Doc_16330766_340_362_Disease shares clinical characteristics with Doc_16330766_400_423_Disease in patients with Doc_16330766_441_457_Disease.
16330766	3	459	Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with Doc_16330766_542_554_Disease as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization.
16330766	4	628	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Doc_16330766_679_689_Chemical, a drug effective in Doc_16330766_711_727_Disease patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states.
16330766	5	829	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the Doc_16330766_917_927_Chemical-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and Doc_16330766_1034_1043_Chemical-induced Doc_16330766_1052_1074_Disease.
16330766	6	1076	The dose of Doc_16330766_1088_1098_Chemical was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration.
16330766	7	1148	We found that (i) Doc_16330766_1166_1176_Chemical reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) Doc_16330766_1303_1313_Chemical reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) Doc_16330766_1396_1406_Chemical suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation.
16330766	8	1550	The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal.
16330766	9	1637	These findings indicate that Doc_16330766_1666_1676_Chemical has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that Doc_16330766_1846_1856_Chemical is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.

16337777	1	105	Doc_16337777_105_132_Disease have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis, such as energy generation, control of cell Doc_16337777_238_243_Disease, neurotransmitter synthesis, and free radical (FR) production.
16337777	2	307	Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits.
16337777	3	464	In this study, we investigated whether increased generation of FR during Doc_16337777_537_555_Disease would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), complex IV of the respiratory chain, in the chronic phase of the Doc_16337777_741_752_Chemical model of Doc_16337777_762_784_Disease.
16337777	4	786	DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups.
16337777	5	936	We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA-encoded subunit of CCO (CCO-I) or a relative decrease in CCO-I when compared with nuclear-encoded subunits (CCO-IV and SDH-fp).
16337777	6	1141	No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry.
16337777	7	1209	Although evidences of Doc_16337777_1231_1258_Disease were found in previously published studies, our results do not suggest that the FRs, generated during the acute phase, determined important abnormalities in mtDNA, in expression of CCO-I, and in CCO activity.

1639466	2	419	Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, Doc_1639466_465_477_Disease rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated Doc_1639466_551_563_Disease controls (n = 8), Doc_1639466_582_591_Chemical-treated (n = 8), or Doc_1639466_612_624_Chemical-treated (n = 10).
1639466	3	643	Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8).
1639466	4	720	After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats.
1639466	5	858	Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis.
1639466	6	936	Doc_1639466_936_945_Chemical but not Doc_1639466_954_966_Chemical reduced blood pressure significantly.
1639466	7	1005	After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups.
1639466	8	1102	Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and Doc_1639466_1157_1175_Disease did not change after Doc_1639466_1197_1206_Chemical treatment.
1639466	9	1218	In contrast, in the Doc_1639466_1238_1250_Chemical-treated group Doc_1639466_1265_1276_Disease increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the Doc_1639466_1372_1384_Disease controls.
1639466	10	1395	Furthermore, Doc_1639466_1408_1426_Disease index was significantly increased in the Doc_1639466_1468_1480_Chemical-treated group compared with the Doc_1639466_1513_1525_Disease controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04).
1639466	11	1572	In addition, glomerular size was higher in the Doc_1639466_1619_1631_Chemical-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the Doc_1639466_1690_1699_Chemical-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the Doc_1639466_1759_1771_Disease controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

16574712	2	258	The current study aimed to assess the impact of Doc_16574712_306_310_Chemical use on three separate central executive processes (set shifting, inhibition and memory updating) and also on "prefrontal" mediated social and emotional judgement processes.
16574712	3	484	Fifteen polydrug Doc_16574712_501_508_Chemical users and 15 polydrug non-Doc_16574712_535_542_Chemical user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire, the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task (set shifting), Backward Digit Span procedure (memory updating), Inhibition of Return (inhibition), an emotional intelligence scale, the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX).

16574712	5	1024	The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use.
16574712	6	1107	These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational Doc_16574712_1246_1253_Chemical use.

17111419	2	174	The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor.
17111419	3	247	Past medical history was remarkable for Doc_17111419_287_299_Disease, Doc_17111419_301_315_Disease, and Doc_17111419_321_331_Disease.
17111419	4	333	Reported medications included Doc_17111419_363_373_Chemical, Doc_17111419_375_386_Chemical, and Doc_17111419_392_402_Chemical.
17111419	5	404	Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet.
17111419	6	512	She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity Doc_17111419_587_593_Disease.
17111419	7	595	Empirical treatment with intravenous Doc_17111419_632_649_Chemical was initiated, and Doc_17111419_669_688_Disease slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
17111419	8	742	The events are consistent with a severe reaction to Doc_17111419_794_801_Chemical chelation by Doc_17111419_815_829_Chemical anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic Doc_17111419_878_890_Disease.
17111419	9	892	Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that Doc_17111419_950_960_Chemical is a Doc_17111419_966_979_Chemical that may cause significant Doc_17111419_1007_1019_Disease.
17111419	10	1021	We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to Doc_17111419_1114_1126_Disease is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to Doc_17111419_1182_1189_Chemical Doc_17111419_1190_1198_Disease.

17147461	4	493	Because Doc_17147461_501_510_Chemical does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-Doc_17147461_629_640_Disease drug'.
17147461	5	648	However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, Doc_17147461_714_723_Chemical is associated with Doc_17147461_743_754_Disease and Doc_17147461_759_782_Disease.
17147461	6	784	A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing Doc_17147461_844_864_Disease.
17147461	7	866	The mechanisms of Doc_17147461_884_893_Chemical-associated Doc_17147461_905_916_Disease are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal.
17147461	8	1043	It has also been suggested that Doc_17147461_1075_1084_Chemical directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive.

17175308	2	132	More recently, Doc_17175308_147_158_Disease has been reported as a consequence of Doc_17175308_197_206_Chemical therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear.
17175308	3	261	We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased Doc_17175308_371_382_Disease after Doc_17175308_389_392_Chemical conversion.
17175308	4	405	The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with Doc_17175308_460_463_Chemical as conversion therapy, due to Doc_17175308_494_523_Disease (Doc_17175308_525_528_Disease) (n = 15) Doc_17175308_539_548_Disease (n = 8); Doc_17175308_558_574_Disease, Four Doc_17175308_581_593_Disease, One Doc_17175308_599_616_Disease, One Doc_17175308_622_641_Disease) or BK virus Doc_17175308_655_666_Disease (n = 2).
17175308	5	676	Doc_17175308_676_679_Chemical was started at a mean of 78 +/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation.
17175308	6	757	Mean follow-up on Doc_17175308_775_778_Chemical therapy was 20 +/- 12 (6 to 43) months.
17175308	7	819	Doc_17175308_819_830_Disease increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g/d before conversion to 3.2 g/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001).
17175308	8	939	Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no Doc_17175308_981_992_Disease, whereas afterwards all patients had Doc_17175308_1030_1041_Disease.
17175308	9	1043	In 28% of patients Doc_17175308_1062_1073_Disease remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients.
17175308	10	1135	In 40% it increased by more than 100%.
17175308	11	1174	Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased Doc_17175308_1224_1235_Disease to the Doc_17175308_1243_1252_Disease range.
17175308	12	1260	Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One Doc_17175308_1335_1371_Disease and Doc_17175308_1376_1398_Disease.
17175308	13	1400	These patients showed persistently good graft function.
17175308	14	1456	Serum Doc_17175308_1462_1472_Chemical values did not change significantly: 1.98 +/- 0.8 mg/dL before Doc_17175308_1536_1539_Chemical therapy and 2.53 +/- 1.9 mg/dL at last follow-up (P = .14).

1720453	7	1016	Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had Doc_1720453_1097_1116_Disease.
1720453	8	1118	Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major Doc_1720453_1264_1272_Disease resulting in Doc_1720453_1286_1304_Disease (Doc_1720453_1306_1310_Disease); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low Doc_1720453_1404_1413_Chemical reabsorption.
1720453	9	1428	The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria.
1720453	10	1496	Severe Doc_1720453_1503_1511_Disease was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of Doc_1720453_1573_1583_Chemical, a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic Doc_1720453_1666_1671_Disease involvement.

17241784	3	320	We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases.
17241784	4	374	All had myofibre Doc_17241784_391_399_Disease but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate.
17241784	5	443	In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up-regulation of MHC-I expression even in non-Doc_17241784_534_542_Disease fibres.
17241784	6	551	Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of Doc_17241784_617_629_Chemical and Doc_17241784_634_646_Chemical, and in one case spontaneously.
17241784	7	679	These observations suggest that Doc_17241784_711_718_Chemical may initiate an immune-mediated Doc_17241784_751_759_Disease that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy.
17241784	8	846	The mechanism of this Doc_17241784_868_876_Disease is uncertain but may involve the induction by Doc_17241784_923_930_Chemical of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up-regulation of MHC-I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres.

17242861	5	760	Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to Doc_17242861_858_869_Chemical-induced Doc_17242861_878_886_Disease.
17242861	6	888	Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice.
17242861	7	964	B6 mice were resistant to Doc_17242861_990_998_Disease and slower to reach stages compared to A/J mice.
17242861	8	1048	The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype.
17242861	9	1166	Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice.

17244258	2	263	Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by Doc_17244258_323_331_Disease was presently investigated.
17244258	3	360	Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and Doc_17244258_417_433_Chemical-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists.
17244258	4	603	Generally, Doc_17244258_614_622_Chemical reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations.
17244258	5	781	In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with Doc_17244258_830_876_Chemical (Doc_17244258_878_894_Chemical) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz).
17244258	6	951	The muscarinic receptor antagonists Doc_17244258_987_995_Chemical, Doc_17244258_997_1033_Chemical (Doc_17244258_1035_1041_Chemical) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), Doc_17244258_1073_1086_Chemical ('M(2)-selective') and Doc_17244258_1110_1121_Chemical ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component.

17244258	7	1380	In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the Doc_17244258_1542_1553_Chemical and Doc_17244258_1558_1564_Chemical antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls.
17244258	8	1641	In contrast to controls, Doc_17244258_1666_1679_Chemical increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies.
17244258	9	1758	While contractions to Doc_17244258_1780_1789_Chemical and Doc_17244258_1794_1797_Chemical were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference Doc_17244258_1874_1883_Chemical response, Doc_17244258_1894_1906_Chemical-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips.
17244258	10	1960	Thus, in Doc_17244258_1969_1977_Disease substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur.

17261653	2	312	Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug Doc_17261653_435_444_Chemical; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of Doc_17261653_538_547_Chemical.
17261653	3	549	METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether Doc_17261653_586_595_Chemical elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-).
17261653	4	767	Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of Doc_17261653_855_864_Chemical; however, Doc_17261653_875_884_Chemical significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm.

17261653	8	1478	As a consequence of blocking I(f), Doc_17261653_1513_1522_Chemical reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice.

17343925	4	394	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal Doc_17343925_463_470_Chemical on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates.
17343925	5	543	This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for Doc_17343925_612_630_Disease and involved both ears of 200 newborns.
17343925	6	671	Newborns whose mothers reported Doc_17343925_703_710_Chemical during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers.
17343925	7	832	Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36).
17343925	8	1004	In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates.
17343925	9	1157	Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences.
17343925	10	1242	However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant Doc_17343925_1331_1361_Disease at 4000Hz for all three groups.
17343925	11	1394	Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group.
17343925	12	1509	In utero, exposure to tobacco Doc_17343925_1551_1558_Chemical seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells.
17343925	13	1609	These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure.

17400887	4	544	We studied the effects of Doc_17400887_570_581_Chemical on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats.
17400887	5	678	Newborn rats were given Doc_17400887_702_713_Chemical (10 mg/kg) daily on postnatal days (PN) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30.
17400887	6	828	Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of Doc_17400887_886_897_Chemical on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex, as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter.
17400887	7	1055	None of these effects occurred in animals given Doc_17400887_1103_1114_Chemical on PN 11 to 14.
17400887	8	1131	In behavioral tests, animals treated with Doc_17400887_1173_1184_Chemical on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper-reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field, as well as in the acoustic startle response test.
17400887	9	1364	Our findings indicate that beta2-adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and Doc_17400887_1545_1569_Disease, similar to those described in Doc_17400887_1601_1607_Disease.

17437408	0	0	Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles Doc_17437408_90_97_Disease-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats.
17437408	1	168	The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
17437408	2	448	MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats.
17437408	3	732	By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that Doc_17437408_861_870_Chemical is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB.
17437408	4	907	However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur.
17437408	5	1064	This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats.
17437408	6	1267	The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively.
17437408	7	1526	Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats.
17437408	8	1727	TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls.
17437408	9	1854	No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections.
17437408	10	1922	A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after Doc_17437408_1987_1998_Chemical-induced Doc_17437408_2007_2015_Disease in wild-type Wistar rats.
17437408	11	2042	Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate Doc_17437408_2104_2117_Chemical and the selective Pgp inhibitor Doc_17437408_2150_2160_Chemical in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB.
17437408	12	2261	The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB.
17437408	13	2390	Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce Doc_17437408_2457_2476_Disease from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB.
17437408	14	2594	Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing Doc_17437408_2784_2792_Disease or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.

1749407	2	239	In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, Doc_1749407_312_339_Disease may result from an increase in myocardial Doc_1749407_382_388_Chemical demand associated with Doc_1749407_412_419_Chemical-induced increase in rate-pressure product.
1749407	3	463	In other individuals with no underlying Doc_1749407_503_530_Disease, Doc_1749407_532_550_Disease may be due to Doc_1749407_565_570_Disease, Doc_1749407_572_580_Disease, or both.
1749407	4	591	With regard to Doc_1749407_606_611_Disease, the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of Doc_1749407_680_687_Chemical-induced vasoconstriction remains speculative.
1749407	5	734	Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that Doc_1749407_814_819_Disease involves the epicardial, medium-size vessels, other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction.
1749407	6	914	Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental, discrete Doc_1749407_1004_1014_Disease.
1749407	7	1016	Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha-mediated, other in vitro data suggest the opposite.
1749407	8	1134	The finding of Doc_1749407_1149_1156_Chemical-induced vasoconstriction in segments of (noninnervated) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha-mediated effects.
1749407	9	1398	Finally, the contribution of a primary, Doc_1749407_1438_1448_Disease effect of Doc_1749407_1459_1466_Chemical has not been excluded.

17532790	4	409	In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally Doc_17532790_541_558_Chemical-lesion rat model of Doc_17532790_579_581_Disease treated with saline, Doc_17532790_603_609_Chemical or Doc_17532790_613_626_Chemical using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS).
17532790	5	708	Rats treated with Doc_17532790_726_732_Chemical were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of Doc_17532790_798_801_Disease.
17532790	6	803	Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS).
17532790	7	1098	Out of these 67 proteins, Doc_17532790_1124_1127_Disease significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit.
17532790	8	1301	Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach.
17532790	9	1476	In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in Doc_17532790_1562_1565_Disease.

17562951	2	363	METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of Doc_17562951_459_468_Chemical and Doc_17562951_473_482_Chemical in patients with Doc_17562951_500_522_Disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions.
17562951	3	653	Serum Doc_17562951_659_669_Chemical (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications.
17562951	4	795	The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline.
17562951	5	893	Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr.
17562951	6	1058	In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of Doc_17562951_1104_1121_Disease, use of Doc_17562951_1130_1146_Chemical, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.
17562951	7	1241	SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after Doc_17562951_1315_1324_Chemical and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after Doc_17562951_1361_1370_Chemical (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44).

17600377	3	510	Doc_17600377_510_530_Chemical was found to attenuate Doc_17600377_554_572_Disease in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the Doc_17600377_691_717_Chemical-infused rats.
17600377	4	732	We also examined the neuroprotective effects of Doc_17600377_780_800_Chemical in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells.
17600377	5	831	Cells were pretreated with Doc_17600377_858_878_Chemical, before exposed to Doc_17600377_898_924_Chemical, Doc_17600377_926_935_Chemical or Doc_17600377_939_943_Chemical.
17600377	6	945	We found that Doc_17600377_959_979_Chemical significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation.
17600377	7	1110	Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that Doc_17600377_1186_1206_Chemical is a potentially effective candidate against Doc_17600377_1252_1271_Disease that is characterized by wide spread Doc_17600377_1309_1323_Disease and progressive Doc_17600377_1340_1369_Disease.

17854040	8	1401	To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV Doc_17854040_1472_1482_Chemical-resistant strains in therapy-Doc_17854040_1512_1514_Chemical  ve Doc_17854040_1519_1538_Disease patients.
17854040	9	1549	The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively.
17854040	10	1703	It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when Doc_17854040_1838_1848_Chemical-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of Doc_17854040_2031_2050_Disease patients.

17879945	1	113	Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as Doc_17879945_224_233_Chemical.
17879945	2	235	Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as Doc_17879945_307_332_Disease.
17879945	3	334	We have previously demonstrated that Doc_17879945_371_380_Chemical treatment increases Doc_17879945_401_423_Disease formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice.
17879945	4	488	Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from Doc_17879945_542_551_Chemical-treated females had less Doc_17879945_577_594_Chemical accumulation.
17879945	5	609	In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence Doc_17879945_712_723_Chemical metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor Doc_17879945_792_801_Chemical.
17879945	6	803	We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question.
17879945	7	893	Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM Doc_17879945_1026_1042_Chemical (Doc_17879945_1044_1046_Chemical), 100 nM Doc_17879945_1056_1068_Chemical or vehicle (0.01% Doc_17879945_1087_1094_Chemical).
17879945	8	1097	Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml Doc_17879945_1135_1144_Chemical or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated.
17879945	9	1267	Doc_17879945_1267_1269_Chemical decreased the accumulation of Doc_17879945_1300_1318_Chemical in macrophages following Doc_17879945_1344_1353_Chemical treatment.
17879945	10	1365	Doc_17879945_1365_1374_Chemical increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL.
17879945	11	1473	Additionally, Doc_17879945_1487_1496_Chemical treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression.
17879945	12	1647	Treatment with Doc_17879945_1662_1664_Chemical, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level.
17879945	13	1728	Doc_17879945_1728_1730_Chemical did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry.
17879945	14	1836	This data suggests that Doc_17879945_1860_1862_Chemical modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced Doc_17879945_1983_2000_Chemical accumulation following Doc_17879945_2024_2033_Chemical treatment.

17919553	5	625	Admission laboratory tests were as follows: Doc_17919553_669_676_Chemical aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); Doc_17919553_732_741_Chemical aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total Doc_17919553_904_913_Chemical, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct Doc_17919553_950_959_Chemical, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL).
17919553	6	1027	No toxin, Doc_17919553_1037_1044_Chemical, or other drugs were reported.
17919553	7	1076	The patient had suffered a previous episode of "acute Doc_17919553_1130_1139_Disease of unknown origin," that occurred after Doc_17919553_1180_1193_Chemical usage.
17919553	8	1201	Both incidents occurred within a year.
17919553	9	1240	Doc_17919553_1252_1265_Chemical is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use.
17919553	10	1380	It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe Doc_17919553_1449_1468_Disease.
17919553	11	1470	Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo Doc_17919553_1507_1528_Disease probability scale, Doc_17919553_1548_1561_Chemical was the probable cause of acute Doc_17919553_1594_1603_Disease in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced Doc_17919553_1670_1685_Disease.
17919553	12	1687	Recurrence of Doc_17919553_1701_1710_Disease attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed Doc_17919553_1830_1843_Chemical the second time.
17919553	13	1861	Here we report a case of acute Doc_17919553_1904_1913_Disease probably associated with the administration of Doc_17919553_1961_1974_Chemical.

17931375	1	94	This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on Doc_17931375_175_183_Disease and Doc_17931375_188_192_Disease following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of Doc_17931375_255_262_Chemical.
17931375	2	264	Although different methods to prevent Doc_17931375_314_322_Disease and Doc_17931375_327_331_Disease following the subcutaneous injection of Doc_17931375_372_379_Chemical have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of Doc_17931375_474_482_Disease and Doc_17931375_487_491_Disease is little documented.
17931375	3	514	This study was designed as within-subject, quasi-experimental research.
17931375	4	594	The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous Doc_17931375_673_680_Chemical was administered.
17931375	5	699	Doc_17931375_699_706_Chemical was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site.
17931375	6	807	Injections areas were assessed for the presence of Doc_17931375_858_866_Disease at 48 and 72 hours after each injection.
17931375	7	908	Dimensions of the Doc_17931375_926_934_Disease on the Doc_17931375_942_949_Chemical applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper.
17931375	8	1025	The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure Doc_17931375_1075_1079_Disease intensity and a stop-watch was used to time the Doc_17931375_1128_1132_Disease period.
17931375	9	1141	Data were analysed using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation.
17931375	10	1244	The percentage of Doc_17931375_1271_1279_Disease occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection.
17931375	11	1377	It was determined that the size of the Doc_17931375_1416_1424_Disease was smaller in the 30-second injection.
17931375	12	1465	Doc_17931375_1465_1469_Disease intensity and Doc_17931375_1484_1488_Disease period were statistically significantly lower for the 30-second injection than for the 10-second injection.
17931375	13	1597	It was determined that injection duration had an effect on Doc_17931375_1669_1677_Disease and Doc_17931375_1682_1686_Disease following the subcutaneous administration of Doc_17931375_1732_1739_Chemical.

18004067	1	114	The possible role of Doc_18004067_147_154_Chemical in the development of Doc_18004067_177_191_Disease associated with therapeutic doses of Doc_18004067_229_240_Chemical (Doc_18004067_242_255_Chemical) is currently debated.
18004067	2	279	CASE REPORT: We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of Doc_18004067_345_352_Chemical and who developed Doc_18004067_371_384_Disease within 3-5 days after hospitalization and stopping Doc_18004067_436_443_Chemical consumption while being treated with 4 g Doc_18004067_485_496_Chemical/day.
18004067	3	502	A Doc_18004067_504_515_Chemical serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range.
18004067	4	590	Possible risk factors for the development of Doc_18004067_635_649_Disease in patients treated with therapeutic doses of Doc_18004067_696_707_Chemical are discussed.
18004067	5	723	In patients with risk factors, e.g. regular consumption of Doc_18004067_794_801_Chemical, Doc_18004067_803_816_Disease is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested.
18004067	6	866	We propose that the Doc_18004067_886_897_Chemical dose should not exceed 2 g/day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with Doc_18004067_1029_1040_Chemical.

18020536	5	729	Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission.
18020536	6	892	Data on use of Doc_18020536_907_911_Chemical/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records.
18020536	7	1015	Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables.
18020536	8	1168	The residual serum concentrations of Doc_18020536_1205_1213_Chemical, Doc_18020536_1215_1224_Chemical and Doc_18020536_1229_1238_Chemical were analysed.
18020536	9	1254	The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31).
18020536	10	1334	Two or three Doc_18020536_1347_1351_Chemical/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20).
18020536	11	1407	Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed Doc_18020536_1568_1576_Disease.
18020536	12	1578	After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of Doc_18020536_1638_1642_Chemical/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE.
18020536	13	1715	However, use of Doc_18020536_1731_1735_Chemical/RDs was associated with Doc_18020536_1760_1769_Disease, Doc_18020536_1771_1789_Disease after awaking at night and Doc_18020536_1817_1826_Disease in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger Doc_18020536_1896_1915_Disease measured at the beginning of the hospital stay.
18020536	14	1964	Use of Doc_18020536_1971_1975_Chemical/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission.
18020536	15	2100	A higher residual serum concentration of Doc_18020536_2141_2150_Chemical correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables.
18020536	16	2234	Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses.

18083142	6	951	Doc_18083142_951_958_Chemical-induced Doc_18083142_967_974_Disease was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of Doc_18083142_1039_1049_Chemical, a Doc_18083142_1053_1061_Chemical beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor.
18083142	7	1096	In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist Doc_18083142_1222_1233_Chemical blocked Doc_18083142_1242_1249_Chemical-induced Doc_18083142_1258_1265_Disease-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist Doc_18083142_1350_1358_Chemical and the alpha(2) antagonist Doc_18083142_1387_1396_Chemical had no effect.
18083142	8	1412	These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for Doc_18083142_1523_1530_Chemical-induced Doc_18083142_1539_1546_Disease in mice.

18162529	1	193	Doc_18162529_193_211_Disease can reduce fertility and libido.
18162529	2	245	Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood.
18162529	3	353	We first tested whether chronic Doc_18162529_385_403_Disease inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the Doc_18162529_507_515_Chemical-induced LH surge.
18162529	4	534	Chronic Doc_18162529_542_560_Disease induced by the Doc_18162529_576_584_Chemical antagonist Doc_18162529_596_605_Chemical caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of Doc_18162529_722_731_Chemical.
18162529	5	733	Doc_18162529_733_742_Chemical did not affect the magnitude of a Doc_18162529_777_784_Chemical-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge.
18162529	6	864	Doc_18162529_864_873_Chemical is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway.
18162529	7	1004	To test the hypothesis that Doc_18162529_1032_1040_Chemical increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that Doc_18162529_1124_1133_Chemical greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation.
18162529	8	1187	Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to Doc_18162529_1343_1352_Chemical and Doc_18162529_1357_1366_Chemical.
18162529	9	1368	Doc_18162529_1368_1377_Chemical induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced.
18162529	10	1562	Doc_18162529_1562_1571_Chemical enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS.
18162529	11	1614	Interestingly, Doc_18162529_1629_1638_Chemical also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently.
18162529	12	1702	These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic Doc_18162529_1768_1786_Disease in a Doc_18162529_1792_1799_Chemical-dependent manner.
18162529	13	1818	They also provide evidence for Doc_18162529_1849_1858_Chemical-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.

18308784	4	503	Male rats were subcutaneously injected with Doc_18308784_547_555_Chemical (10 mg/kg) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days, and Doc_18308784_617_620_Chemical (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of Doc_18308784_701_709_Chemical once a day for 10 days.
18308784	5	734	Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze.
18308784	6	799	The results showed that rats treated with Doc_18308784_841_849_Chemical/Doc_18308784_850_853_Chemical decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency.
18308784	7	953	By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo, the results showed that Doc_18308784_1051_1054_Chemical restored the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by Doc_18308784_1109_1117_Chemical in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats.
18308784	8	1164	The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Doc_18308784_1220_1223_Chemical restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with Doc_18308784_1278_1286_Chemical, but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or Doc_18308784_1345_1353_Chemical/Doc_18308784_1354_1357_Chemical-treated rats; this restoration could be inhibited by Doc_18308784_1411_1431_Chemical (Doc_18308784_1433_1437_Chemical) receptor antagonist Doc_18308784_1459_1464_Chemical.
18308784	9	1466	We conclude that Doc_18308784_1483_1486_Chemical may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic Doc_18308784_1562_1570_Chemical administration and restore the Doc_18308784_1602_1610_Chemical-inhibited LTP.

1833784	1	113	Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe Doc_1833784_247_255_Chemical-induced locomotor stimulation.
1833784	2	287	In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of Doc_1833784_391_399_Chemical in rats was examined.

1833784	6	965	The stimulant action of Doc_1833784_989_997_Chemical was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist Doc_1833784_1046_1058_Chemical but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker Doc_1833784_1103_1116_Chemical, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors.
1833784	7	1200	Doc_1833784_1200_1208_Chemical-induced Doc_1833784_1217_1230_Disease was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist Doc_1833784_1274_1283_Chemical, the selective D2 antagonist Doc_1833784_1313_1323_Chemical and the D1/D2 antagonist Doc_1833784_1349_1361_Chemical.

1835291	2	439	Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for Doc_1835291_643_654_Chemical and 17% and 50%, respectively, for Doc_1835291_690_702_Chemical.
1835291	3	704	The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for Doc_1835291_781_792_Chemical and 8% for Doc_1835291_804_816_Chemical.
1835291	4	818	The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with Doc_1835291_865_876_Chemical and 2.4 hours with Doc_1835291_896_908_Chemical.

18410508	2	318	Cardona et al. [Nat.
18410508	3	339	Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of Doc_18410508_466_470_Chemical-induced Doc_18410508_479_496_Disease of Doc_18410508_500_502_Chemical neurons.

18410508	5	742	Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with Doc_18410508_883_887_Chemical and examined for striatal Doc_18410508_914_927_Disease.
18410508	6	929	Doc_18410508_929_933_Chemical depleted Doc_18410508_943_945_Chemical, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls.
18410508	7	1109	The effects of Doc_18410508_1124_1128_Chemical in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum.

18410508	9	1346	This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by Doc_18410508_1498_1502_Chemical.
18410508	10	1504	We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate Doc_18410508_1575_1579_Chemical Doc_18410508_1580_1593_Disease or microglial activation.
18410508	11	1620	Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to Doc_18410508_1688_1692_Chemical with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.

18464113	4	678	The objectives were to assess the efficacy of Doc_18464113_724_734_Chemical in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation, and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT.
18464113	5	833	Two groups were compared in this study.
18464113	6	873	The prophylactic Doc_18464113_890_899_Chemical group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic Doc_18464113_957_967_Chemical treatment.
18464113	7	979	The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic Doc_18464113_1078_1088_Chemical.

18544179	1	107	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with Doc_18544179_201_212_Chemical, Doc_18544179_214_247_Disease occurs frequently.
18544179	2	267	Doc_18544179_267_275_Chemical is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia.
18544179	3	375	This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of Doc_18544179_447_480_Disease and Doc_18544179_485_489_Disease in the first 24 h after Doc_18544179_514_525_Chemical anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients.
18544179	4	573	Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 Doc_18544179_643_651_Chemical, while a third group received Doc_18544179_682_695_Chemical in addition to Doc_18544179_711_719_Chemical.
18544179	5	721	Omission of Doc_18544179_742_750_Chemical did not reduce the overall incidence of Doc_18544179_791_824_Disease, but did reduce the incidence of Doc_18544179_858_866_Disease and/or moderate to severe Doc_18544179_893_899_Disease prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with Doc_18544179_941_949_Chemical and Doc_18544179_954_962_Chemical-Doc_18544179_963_976_Chemical, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013).
18544179	6	1011	Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012).
18544179	7	1085	Doc_18544179_1085_1098_Chemical had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of Doc_18544179_1157_1190_Disease.
18544179	8	1192	Combining the two Doc_18544179_1210_1218_Chemical groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing Doc_18544179_1304_1337_Disease and Doc_18544179_1342_1348_Disease prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while Doc_18544179_1447_1453_Disease in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034).
18544179	9	1515	Doc_18544179_1515_1519_Disease severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of Doc_18544179_1591_1599_Chemical.

18809400	1	107	The study investigates if Doc_18809400_133_150_Chemical is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced Doc_18809400_199_212_Disease, if Doc_18809400_217_237_Disease plays a critical role in Doc_18809400_263_294_Disease, and if neuroprotective effects of Doc_18809400_330_347_Chemical depend on mitochondria protection.
18809400	2	383	We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced Doc_18809400_433_454_Disease that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to Doc_18809400_574_584_Chemical and Doc_18809400_589_598_Chemical, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs.
18809400	3	661	This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of Doc_18809400_713_730_Chemical in preventing Doc_18809400_745_758_Disease and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and Doc_18809400_872_889_Chemical.
18809400	4	891	Our results demonstrate that both Doc_18809400_925_934_Chemical and Doc_18809400_939_949_Chemical cause early Doc_18809400_962_986_Disease with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons.
18809400	5	1068	Doc_18809400_1068_1085_Chemical exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced Doc_18809400_1146_1159_Disease in sensory neurons: it rescues the Doc_18809400_1195_1217_Disease and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties.
18809400	6	1337	In conclusion Doc_18809400_1351_1373_Disease is an early common event both in Doc_18809400_1407_1417_Chemical and Doc_18809400_1422_1431_Chemical induced Doc_18809400_1440_1453_Disease.
18809400	7	1455	Doc_18809400_1455_1472_Chemical protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin.
18809400	8	1609	These findings suggest that Doc_18809400_1637_1654_Chemical might reduce the risk of developing Doc_18809400_1691_1716_Disease in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.

18821488	2	268	Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN Doc_18821488_332_341_Disease, it has been proposed that a stable, long-acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment.
18821488	3	436	Using this rationale, the Doc_18821488_462_478_Chemical Doc_18821488_479_487_Chemical, a potent long-lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs, was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment.
18821488	4	640	In this study, Doc_18821488_664_672_Chemical was administered intravenously (IV) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg/kg; a single male also received Doc_18821488_809_817_Chemical orally (PO) at 7.0 mg/kg.
18821488	5	844	Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure.
18821488	6	908	The selected doses of Doc_18821488_939_947_Chemical, which produced significant Doc_18821488_976_993_Disease in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere, produced very little MHb (mean < 2.0%) in the rhesus monkey.
18821488	7	1110	Furthermore, transient Doc_18821488_1133_1147_Disease was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of Doc_18821488_1200_1208_Chemical (3.5 or 7.0 mg/kg), and 2 lethalities occurred (one IV and one PO) following the 7.0 mg/kg dose.
18821488	8	1306	Doc_18821488_1306_1319_Disease was also observed following the 7.0 mg/kg dose.
18821488	9	1368	Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed Doc_18821488_1428_1453_Disease, with greater severity in the orally-treated animal.

18951540	1	102	In a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of "real" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus "sham" rTMS (placebo) on peak dose Doc_18951540_287_298_Disease in patients with Doc_18951540_316_335_Disease (Doc_18951540_337_339_Disease).
18951540	2	342	Ten patients with Doc_18951540_360_362_Disease and prominent Doc_18951540_377_388_Disease had rTMS (1,800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series.
18951540	3	636	Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed Doc_18951540_744_754_Disease severity.
18951540	4	765	However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in Doc_18951540_845_855_Disease severity following real rTMS but not placebo.
18951540	5	902	The major effect was on Doc_18951540_926_934_Disease subscore.
18951540	6	945	Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective Doc_18951540_1032_1042_Disease scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only.
18951540	7	1166	Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and Doc_18951540_1243_1245_Disease symptoms were noted.

1919871	1	102	Doc_1919871_102_126_Disease (Doc_1919871_128_131_Disease) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with Doc_1919871_232_239_Chemical and Doc_1919871_244_255_Chemical in female Fischer 344 rats.
1919871	2	284	Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible.
1919871	3	484	There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment.
1919871	4	695	The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage.
1919871	5	857	During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover.
1919871	6	1065	This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to Doc_1919871_1248_1251_Disease.
1919871	7	1253	The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.

19211690	1	112	Blood pressure (BP) is more Doc_19211690_140_144_Chemical sensitive in men than in premenopausal women.
19211690	2	191	In Dahl Doc_19211690_199_203_Chemical-sensitive rats (DS), high-Doc_19211690_230_234_Chemical (HS) diet increases BP more in males than females.
19211690	3	286	In contrast to the systemic renin-Doc_19211690_320_331_Chemical system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed.
19211690	4	494	In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS-induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by Doc_19211690_638_650_Chemical that also causes increases in BP and Doc_19211690_688_700_Disease.
19211690	5	702	On a low-Doc_19211690_711_715_Chemical (LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females.
19211690	6	802	HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration.
19211690	7	929	Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet.
19211690	8	1025	Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet.
19211690	9	1101	HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and Doc_19211690_1190_1210_Disease in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration.
19211690	10	1265	Doc_19211690_1265_1277_Chemical replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP, Doc_19211690_1325_1337_Disease, and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet.
19211690	11	1406	Doc_19211690_1406_1418_Chemical contributes to the development of Doc_19211690_1453_1465_Disease and Doc_19211690_1470_1482_Disease in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin-Doc_19211690_1564_1575_Chemical system.

19269743	2	227	Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental Doc_19269743_320_324_Disease are sparse.
19269743	3	337	In order to address long-term Doc_19269743_367_371_Disease memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of Doc_19269743_459_468_Chemical (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals.
19269743	4	611	Doc_19269743_611_615_Disease rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale (0-100) digitized at 1/s, either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection.
19269743	5	772	Subjects also recalled their Doc_19269743_801_806_Disease one week later.
19269743	6	823	Doc_19269743_823_832_Chemical injection reliably induced a dose-dependent flare (p<0.001) without any difference within or across sessions.
19269743	7	943	The strong burning Doc_19269743_962_966_Disease decayed exponentially within a few minutes.
19269743	8	1011	Subjects were able to reliably discriminate Doc_19269743_1055_1059_Disease magnitude and duration across Doc_19269743_1090_1099_Chemical doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day.
19269743	9	1224	Doc_19269743_1224_1228_Disease recall after one week was similarly precise (magnitude: p<0.01, duration: p<0.05).
19269743	10	1312	Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first-time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection (R(2)=0.79) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces.
19269743	11	1524	These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced Doc_19269743_1618_1622_Disease.
19269743	12	1624	The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage, and may take up to one day.

19299179	1	153	Doc_19299179_153_175_Disease (Doc_19299179_177_180_Disease), a common Doc_19299179_192_215_Disease in Doc_19299179_219_231_Disease individuals, is generally treated with high doses of Doc_19299179_285_299_Chemical.
19299179	2	301	However, treatment is often limited by adverse effects.
19299179	3	357	Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised Doc_19299179_413_425_Disease patients who developed severe Doc_19299179_456_480_Disease, and in one patient lesions mimicking Doc_19299179_519_532_Disease formation on radiologic exams, during Doc_19299179_571_585_Chemical treatment for Doc_19299179_600_603_Disease.
19299179	4	605	Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged Doc_19299179_717_731_Chemical treatment, therapy of patient 2 was switched early.

19300402	1	176	The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive Doc_19300402_244_246_Chemical synthase (L-NOArg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible Doc_19300402_327_329_Chemical synthase (L-NIL; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal Doc_19300402_409_411_Chemical synthase (7-NI; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] Doc_19300402_549_559_Chemical (Doc_19300402_561_568_Chemical; 70 nmol/kg ip) or Doc_19300402_588_605_Chemical (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of Doc_19300402_648_724_Disease was investigated.
19300402	2	743	The changes in Doc_19300402_767_771_Disease thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli--the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall-Selitto.
19300402	3	907	The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of Doc_19300402_969_979_Chemical receptors and inducible Doc_19300402_1004_1006_Chemical synthase but not neuronal Doc_19300402_1033_1035_Chemical synthase activity reduces Doc_19300402_1062_1083_Disease.
19300402	4	1085	Pretreatment with L-NOArg and L-NIL but not 7-NI, significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both Doc_19300402_1190_1197_Chemical and Doc_19300402_1202_1219_Chemical.
19300402	5	1221	It was also shown that both products of inducible Doc_19300402_1271_1273_Chemical synthase and neuronal Doc_19300402_1296_1298_Chemical synthase activation as well as Doc_19300402_1330_1340_Chemical are involved in Doc_19300402_1357_1369_Disease produced by Doc_19300402_1382_1393_Chemical.
19300402	6	1395	Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of Doc_19300402_1475_1482_Chemical or Doc_19300402_1486_1502_Chemical in Doc_19300402_1506_1522_Disease.
19300402	7	1524	Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both Doc_19300402_1654_1683_Disease.

19308880	2	213	Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published.
19308880	3	333	We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction.
19308880	4	434	Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of Doc_19308880_513_522_Disease reported since 1985 with Doc_19308880_548_561_Chemical.
19308880	5	563	272 cases of Doc_19308880_585_594_Disease were reported with Doc_19308880_614_627_Chemical: 153 women and 119 men.
19308880	6	652	Doc_19308880_652_661_Disease mostly occurred during the two first weeks following Doc_19308880_715_728_Chemical exposure (39.7%).
19308880	7	747	It was "serious" for almost 2/3 of the patients (62.5%) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases (82%).
19308880	8	858	The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years.
19308880	9	945	This work shows that Doc_19308880_978_987_Disease with Doc_19308880_993_1006_Chemical is a serious, rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction.

19346865	2	394	MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having Doc_19346865_511_524_Chemical-induced Doc_19346865_533_547_Disease (age range; 43-78 years).
19346865	3	574	They had been taking Doc_19346865_595_608_Chemical (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the Doc_19346865_678_687_Disease in various organs.
19346865	4	707	Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8).
19346865	5	906	Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of Doc_19346865_999_1012_Chemical administration.
19346865	6	1029	Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images.
19346865	7	1249	Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8).
19346865	8	1501	High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map.
19346865	9	1706	All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus Doc_19346865_1869_1884_Disease persisted.
19346865	10	1896	Reversible Doc_19346865_1920_1947_Disease could be considered as the characteristic for Doc_19346865_1994_2007_Chemical-induced Doc_19346865_2016_2030_Disease, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.

19356053	5	679	We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom Doc_19356053_845_854_Chemical was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen.
19356053	6	907	In these patients, the magnitude of Doc_19356053_943_954_Disease was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:Doc_19356053_1046_1056_Chemical ratios, an estimate of grams of Doc_19356053_1089_1100_Disease/day.

19657887	2	209	Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits Doc_19657887_300_308_Chemical dehydrogenase and can induce Doc_19657887_338_350_Chemical syndrome in case of Doc_19657887_371_378_Chemical use.
19657887	3	384	The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a Doc_19657887_441_451_Chemical-like syndrome following occupational exposure to Doc_19657887_501_519_Chemical.
19657887	4	521	The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Doc_19657887_572_578_Chemical, which contains Doc_19657887_595_613_Chemical, without protection after consuming a large amount of Doc_19657887_668_675_Chemical during a meal.
19657887	5	691	In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of Doc_19657887_734_741_Chemical, he developed malaise with Doc_19657887_769_789_Disease, Doc_19657887_791_802_Disease, and Doc_19657887_808_815_Disease.
19657887	6	817	Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital.
19657887	7	892	The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Doc_19657887_974_980_Chemical.
19657887	8	982	Five hours after exposure, he developed Doc_19657887_1022_1032_Chemical-like syndrome with Doc_19657887_1052_1060_Disease, Doc_19657887_1062_1073_Disease, and Doc_19657887_1079_1099_Disease after consuming three glasses of wine.
19657887	9	1139	The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital.

19729346	1	122	This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release Doc_19729346_238_247_Chemical in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily Doc_19729346_377_381_Disease.
19729346	2	383	Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg Doc_19729346_495_504_Chemical).
19729346	3	507	Plasma Doc_19729346_514_523_Chemical concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01).
19729346	4	726	Significant Doc_19729346_738_815_Disease were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose.
19729346	5	950	For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge.
19729346	6	1133	This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from Doc_19729346_1210_1222_Disease, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release Doc_19729346_1316_1325_Chemical are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults.

19759529	3	463	As a result, there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the Doc_19759529_667_671_Chemical receptor.
19759529	4	682	Among them are Doc_19759529_697_704_Chemical transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitors such as Doc_19759529_746_755_Chemical, which indirectly enhance Doc_19759529_782_786_Chemical receptor function by increasing the Doc_19759529_823_830_Chemical (a co-agonist for the Doc_19759529_853_857_Chemical receptor) levels in the synapse.
19759529	5	891	This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of Doc_19759529_972_981_Chemical, with a particular focus on models of Doc_19759529_1020_1033_Disease, involving either drug challenge (ie, Doc_19759529_1072_1083_Chemical and Doc_19759529_1088_1094_Chemical) or transgenic mice (ie, Doc_19759529_1120_1124_Chemical Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)).
19759529	6	1152	Results showed that Doc_19759529_1172_1181_Chemical (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked Doc_19759529_1209_1222_Disease induced by the non-competitive Doc_19759529_1254_1258_Chemical receptor antagonist, Doc_19759529_1280_1286_Chemical and partially reversed spontaneous Doc_19759529_1322_1335_Disease of Doc_19759529_1339_1343_Chemical Nr1(neo-/-) mice.
19759529	7	1362	In contrast, Doc_19759529_1375_1384_Chemical failed to affect Doc_19759529_1402_1415_Disease induced by Doc_19759529_1427_1438_Chemical or naturally observed in Doc_19759529_1464_1472_Chemical transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.).

19759529	9	1694	However, unlike these latter, Doc_19759529_1724_1733_Chemical did not produce Doc_19759529_1750_1759_Disease (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o. Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor, Doc_19759529_1863_1872_Chemical, produces antipsychotic-like effects, which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system, and has a reduced side-effect potential as compared with these latter drugs.

19889778	1	166	Immune escape variants of the Doc_19889778_196_207_Disease virus (HBV) represent an emerging clinical challenge, because they can be associated with vaccine escape, HBV reactivation, and failure of diagnostic tests.
19889778	2	365	Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals.
19889778	3	512	We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to Doc_19889778_774_784_Chemical (Doc_19889778_786_789_Chemical) and/or Doc_19889778_798_803_Chemical negativity.

19889778	5	1046	The sG145R mutation strongly reduced Doc_19889778_1083_1088_Chemical levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of Doc_19889778_1154_1157_Chemical-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication.
19889778	6	1272	Although the sP120T substitution also impaired Doc_19889778_1319_1324_Chemical secretion, it did not enhance the replication of Doc_19889778_1374_1377_Chemical-resistant clones.
19889778	7	1396	However, the concomitant occurrence of Doc_19889778_1435_1440_Chemical negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and Doc_19889778_1474_1477_Chemical resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV.
19889778	8	1560	In all clones with combined immune escape and Doc_19889778_1606_1609_Chemical resistance mutations, the Doc_19889778_1636_1646_Chemical analogues Doc_19889778_1657_1665_Chemical and Doc_19889778_1670_1679_Chemical remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.
19889778	9	1742	These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants, supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns.

2273650	2	392	Similarly, pre-test Doc_2273650_412_423_Chemical partially reversed the Doc_2273650_447_458_Chemical-induced Doc_2273650_467_474_Disease, but not significantly; and pre-test Doc_2273650_512_525_Chemical failed to reverse the Doc_2273650_548_561_Chemical-induced Doc_2273650_570_577_Disease.
2273650	3	579	These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre-test Doc_2273650_655_663_Chemical might be the direct action of Doc_2273650_694_702_Chemical rather than a state dependent effect.

227508	5	704	These findings indicate that in spontaneously Doc_227508_750_762_Disease rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors.
227508	6	862	As Doc_227508_865_873_Chemical and Doc_227508_878_887_Chemical do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by Doc_227508_1026_1035_Chemical or Doc_227508_1039_1055_Chemical and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.

230316	2	232	In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of Doc_230316_354_364_Chemical could be excluded.
230316	3	384	Of the remainder, a relationship to Doc_230316_420_430_Chemical was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases.
230316	4	487	In six of the probable cases the Doc_230316_520_544_Disease consisted of an acute reversible Doc_230316_578_592_Disease usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of Doc_230316_644_654_Chemical over a short period.
230316	5	676	The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated Doc_230316_750_763_Disease.
230316	6	765	This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received Doc_230316_835_845_Chemical as treatment for Doc_230316_863_891_Disease.
230316	7	893	In the remaining cases, a combination of Doc_230316_934_944_Disease, Doc_230316_946_964_Disease, and Doc_230316_970_991_Disease was the most common manifestation.
230316	8	1027	Isolated Doc_230316_1036_1046_Disease or Doc_230316_1050_1071_Disease, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent.
230316	9	1134	The onset of all manifestations (except toxic Doc_230316_1180_1194_Disease) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery.
230316	10	1252	Older subjects tended to display more side effects.
230316	11	1304	The full syndrome of subacute Doc_230316_1334_1356_Disease was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.

2304736	1	38	A case of genuine Doc_2304736_56_75_Disease due to Doc_2304736_83_91_Chemical, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented.
2304736	2	139	Doc_2304736_139_147_Chemical exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
2304736	3	282	As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra.
2304736	4	381	The patient's clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on Doc_2304736_480_488_Chemical and subsequent studies while taking Doc_2304736_525_534_Chemical.
2304736	5	536	Her Doc_2304736_540_552_Disease resolved with the change of medication.
2304736	6	593	The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length.
2304736	7	758	Patients who present with Doc_2304736_784_803_Disease while taking Doc_2304736_817_825_Chemical should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their Doc_2304736_916_928_Disease may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy.

234669	1	110	Doc_234669_110_129_Disease have frequently been reported in association with Doc_234669_180_199_Disease.
234669	2	201	The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating Doc_234669_269_289_Disease in patients with Doc_234669_307_326_Disease has only recently been emphasized.
234669	3	362	The effects of Doc_234669_377_390_Chemical on the Doc_234669_398_422_Disease threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during Doc_234669_479_498_Disease were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs.
234669	4	545	The Doc_234669_549_573_Disease threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle.
234669	5	738	During the infusion of Doc_234669_761_774_Chemical, the Doc_234669_780_804_Disease threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of Doc_234669_895_901_Chemical (Doc_234669_903_906_Chemical) and Doc_234669_912_926_Chemical (Doc_234669_928_931_Chemical) were kept within normal limits.
234669	6	965	When Doc_234669_970_989_Disease was produced by Doc_234669_1006_1021_Disease (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of Doc_234669_1095_1108_Chemical resulted in an even greater decrease in Doc_234669_1149_1173_Disease threshold to 60 percent of the control level.
234669	7	1220	These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of Doc_234669_1318_1341_Disease in Doc_234669_1345_1364_Disease, pharmacologic agents, particularly Doc_234669_1401_1414_Chemical, may play a significant role.

2348231	1	146	Doc_2348231_146_158_Chemical-Doc_2348231_159_167_Chemical-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of Doc_2348231_241_268_Disease.
2348231	2	270	Many of these patients are taking Doc_2348231_304_318_Chemical (Doc_2348231_320_327_Chemical), a Doc_2348231_332_346_Chemical derivative which may improve Doc_2348231_376_401_Disease.
2348231	3	403	Whether Doc_2348231_411_425_Chemical inhibits Doc_2348231_435_447_Chemical-induced coronary Doc_2348231_465_474_Disease like other Doc_2348231_486_501_Chemical such as Doc_2348231_510_522_Chemical and should be stopped prior to Doc_2348231_554_566_Chemical-Doc_2348231_567_575_Chemical-201 imaging is unknown.
2348231	4	600	Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to Doc_2348231_648_660_Chemical in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either Doc_2348231_730_744_Chemical (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or Doc_2348231_775_787_Chemical (3 mg/kg i.v.).
2348231	5	804	Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups.
2348231	6	898	Doc_2348231_898_910_Chemical significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. Doc_2348231_993_1007_Chemical (p less than 0.002).
2348231	7	1029	Neither dose of Doc_2348231_1045_1059_Chemical significantly decreased the Doc_2348231_1088_1100_Chemical-induced Doc_2348231_1109_1118_Disease, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after Doc_2348231_1181_1193_Chemical (p less than 0.01).
2348231	8	1214	We conclude that Doc_2348231_1231_1246_Chemical does not inhibit Doc_2348231_1264_1276_Chemical-induced coronary Doc_2348231_1294_1303_Disease even at high doses.

2385256	2	235	The serum Doc_2385256_245_254_Chemical concentration was 3.0 mEq/L, which is usually well tolerated.
2385256	3	317	The Doc_2385256_321_330_Chemical was stopped and she recovered over a few days.
2385256	4	378	While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting Doc_2385256_525_560_Disease.
2385256	5	562	After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking.
2385256	6	687	Her Doc_2385256_691_704_Chemical receptor antibody level was markedly elevated.
2385256	7	752	Although Doc_2385256_761_770_Disease after Doc_2385256_777_786_Chemical administration has been described in patients with known Doc_2385256_844_861_Disease, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease.
2385256	8	955	Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of Doc_2385256_1024_1033_Chemical should be suspected of having an underlying Doc_2385256_1078_1116_Disease.

2476560	1	39	Treatment for Doc_2476560_53_60_Disease is usually initiated by general practitioners; most consider Doc_2476560_122_129_Chemical (Doc_2476560_131_157_Chemical) the treatment of choice.
2476560	2	184	Doc_2476560_184_191_Chemical is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide, and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood.
2476560	3	331	Evidence is accumulating that Doc_2476560_361_368_Chemical can be Doc_2476560_376_411_Disease and may be associated with Doc_2476560_439_455_Disease.
2476560	4	457	Preparations containing Doc_2476560_481_488_Chemical continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients.
2476560	5	582	This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at-risk groups, and give adequate warnings regarding potential Doc_2476560_767_775_Disease.

2484011	5	618	Subsequent Doc_2484011_629_639_Chemical treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB/C mice being the least sensitive.
2484011	6	780	The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied, except for the ICR mice, during an overnight drug-free period following the fourth Doc_2484011_952_962_Chemical treatment.
2484011	7	974	Readministration of Doc_2484011_994_1004_Chemical, after a drug-free overnight period, increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB/C mice where Doc_2484011_1147_1170_Disease occurred.
2484011	8	1181	Treatment with Doc_2484011_1196_1206_Chemical did not alter whole brain Doc_2484011_1233_1241_Chemical levels but decreased the amounts of Doc_2484011_1278_1308_Chemical in the BALB/C mice compared to saline control.
2484011	9	1356	Conversely, brain Doc_2484011_1374_1389_Chemical concentration was increased from saline control by Doc_2484011_1441_1451_Chemical in the BALB/C mice.
2484011	10	1472	The results suggest a strain-dependent effect of Doc_2484011_1521_1531_Chemical on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used.
2484011	11	1627	The BALB/C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of Doc_2484011_1749_1759_Chemical.
2484011	12	1761	The biochemical results of brain biogenic Doc_2484011_1803_1809_Chemical of BALB/C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of Doc_2484011_1864_1877_Chemical turnover rate and/or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O-methylation of Doc_2484011_1976_1990_Chemical which may account for a Doc_2484011_2015_2036_Disease caused by Doc_2484011_2047_2057_Chemical in the BALB/C mice.

2549018	4	579	Doc_2549018_579_588_Disease appeared to be a common side effect of Doc_2549018_628_638_Chemical and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist Doc_2549018_717_728_Chemical, dose reduction, or both.
2549018	5	755	The authors suggest that Doc_2549018_780_790_Chemical-induced Doc_2549018_799_808_Disease may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of Doc_2549018_929_939_Chemical-induced Doc_2549018_948_957_Disease and tricyclic Doc_2549018_972_986_Chemical-induced "jitteriness" may be identical.

2578334	1	74	To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the Doc_2578334_172_206_Disease, Doc_2578334_208_221_Chemical (Doc_2578334_223_228_Chemical) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, Doc_2578334_364_379_Chemical (200 mg/kg), Doc_2578334_393_415_Chemical (60 mg/kg) and Doc_2578334_431_452_Chemical (Doc_2578334_454_461_Chemical) (100 mg/kg).
2578334	2	476	The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% Doc_2578334_658_679_Chemical coupled with a necrogenic dose of Doc_2578334_714_718_Chemical.
2578334	3	720	The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of Doc_2578334_801_806_Chemical during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in Doc_2578334_911_916_Chemical and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only.
2578334	4	1010	Administration of Doc_2578334_1028_1051_Chemical during the repair synthesis induced by Doc_2578334_1091_1098_Chemical further showed that 0.019 mol % of Doc_2578334_1134_1142_Chemical residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of Doc_2578334_1226_1231_Chemical occurs during repair synthesis.
2578334	5	1264	In the absence of the carcinogen, Doc_2578334_1298_1303_Chemical given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci.
2578334	6	1437	The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation.
2578334	7	1530	Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.

2670794	3	542	The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent.
2670794	4	634	The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Doc_2670794_705_714_Chemical did not influence the extravasation of protein.

2670794	6	867	The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and Doc_2670794_975_979_Chemical alone.
2670794	7	987	It is suggested that the effects of Doc_2670794_1023_1032_Chemical on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Doc_2670794_1138_1153_Chemical and an increase in Doc_2670794_1173_1185_Chemical (secondary to an increase in Doc_2670794_1215_1225_Chemical).
2670794	8	1228	Doc_2670794_1228_1237_Chemical may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less Doc_2670794_1504_1517_Disease will be produced.

2802551	2	239	In salt-depleted rats, Doc_2802551_262_276_Chemical decreased Doc_2802551_287_297_Chemical clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3.
2802551	3	361	In contrast, in normal-salt rats Doc_2802551_394_404_Chemical clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats Doc_2802551_493_503_Chemical clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3.
2802551	4	577	All rats in the Doc_2802551_593_599_Chemical-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat.
2802551	5	761	Concentrations of Doc_2802551_779_793_Chemical in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study.
2802551	6	890	However, at the end of 3 weeks, Doc_2802551_922_936_Chemical levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively.

2870085	0	0	Doc_2870085_0_9_Chemical: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent.
2870085	1	65	Doc_2870085_65_74_Chemical (Doc_2870085_76_84_Chemical) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.
2870085	2	217	Doc_2870085_217_226_Chemical is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes.
2870085	3	325	This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min.
2870085	4	415	In long-term infusion studies, Doc_2870085_446_455_Chemical was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days.
2870085	5	555	Doc_2870085_555_564_Chemical blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of Doc_2870085_686_695_Chemical and beta-adrenergic blockade.
2870085	6	726	Doc_2870085_726_735_Chemical produced a dose-dependent attenuation of Doc_2870085_777_790_Chemical-induced Doc_2870085_799_810_Disease.
2870085	7	812	Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of Doc_2870085_858_867_Chemical are similar to those of other beta blockers.
2870085	8	913	In contrast with other beta blockers, Doc_2870085_951_960_Chemical-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life.
2870085	9	1071	Doc_2870085_1071_1080_Chemical effectively reduced heart rate in patients with Doc_2870085_1129_1161_Disease.

2887062	1	136	To clarify the effects of Doc_2887062_162_175_Chemical on Doc_2887062_179_191_Disease cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to Doc_2887062_288_296_Chemical-induced rat Doc_2887062_309_321_Disease cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of Doc_2887062_359_372_Chemical (3 mg/kg of body weight).
2887062	2	399	One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly.
2887062	3	465	Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the Doc_2887062_613_625_Disease cells.
2887062	4	633	Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased.
2887062	5	785	These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of Doc_2887062_866_879_Chemical treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules.
2887062	6	996	At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls.
2887062	7	1091	The Doc_2887062_1095_1107_Disease cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae.
2887062	8	1232	Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat Doc_2887062_1409_1421_Disease cells.
2887062	9	1429	However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after Doc_2887062_1524_1537_Chemical treatment of the Doc_2887062_1555_1562_Disease cells.
2887062	10	1570	An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that Doc_2887062_1770_1783_Chemical inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.

2924746	3	294	A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic Doc_2924746_354_357_Chemical treatment on Doc_2924746_371_377_Chemical concentrations in the rat.
2924746	4	405	In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, Doc_2924746_463_479_Chemical, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced Doc_2924746_565_573_Disease and inhibited Doc_2924746_588_599_Disease.

2924746	6	773	Oral administration of Doc_2924746_796_799_Chemical as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against Doc_2924746_894_898_Chemical-induced Doc_2924746_907_915_Disease and was minimally toxic as measured by Doc_2924746_955_966_Disease over 8 weeks of treatment.
2924746	7	994	The Doc_2924746_998_1001_Chemical levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective.
2924746	8	1114	This treatment with Doc_2924746_1134_1137_Chemical had no apparent adverse effect on Doc_2924746_1172_1178_Chemical concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the Doc_2924746_1223_1229_Chemical concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.

2951327	1	77	In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal Doc_2951327_132_138_Chemical intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of Doc_2951327_225_239_Chemical and Doc_2951327_244_255_Chemical during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor.
2951327	2	330	Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no Doc_2951327_588_599_Disease and no augmentation of the Doc_2951327_627_641_Chemical release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable Doc_2951327_734_745_Disease induced by Doc_2951327_757_768_Chemical or Doc_2951327_772_785_Chemical.

3015567	0	0	Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback.
3015567	1	146	Doc_3015567_146_159_Chemical-induced Doc_3015567_168_179_Disease evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation.
3015567	2	350	Portal plasma concentrations of neither Doc_3015567_390_410_Chemical nor Doc_3015567_415_423_Chemical are significantly altered in this paradigm.

3031535	2	363	The cataleptogenic effect of Doc_3031535_392_395_Chemical was significantly reduced in rats treated with Doc_3031535_443_449_Chemical and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with Doc_3031535_527_538_Chemical and Doc_3031535_543_549_Chemical, as compared with control rats.
3031535	3	582	On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect of Doc_3031535_628_639_Chemical was significantly reduced in rats treated with Doc_3031535_687_698_Chemical and Doc_3031535_703_709_Chemical but not in rats treated with Doc_3031535_739_745_Chemical or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus.
3031535	4	794	These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of Doc_3031535_891_900_Disease induced by Doc_3031535_912_915_Chemical, whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in Doc_3031535_963_972_Disease induced by Doc_3031535_984_995_Chemical.

3187073	3	282	In the present study, Doc_3187073_304_314_Chemical (80-120 mg/m2BSA) and Doc_3187073_337_341_Chemical (1000 mg/m2BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery.
3187073	4	462	The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment.
3187073	5	571	Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed.
3187073	6	685	In the pre-treatment evaluation, signs of Doc_3187073_727_749_Disease were found in 33 patients (43%).
3187073	7	783	During treatment, adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients (18%).
3187073	8	861	The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group, 64 years.
3187073	9	940	The incidence of Doc_3187073_957_971_Disease was not higher in patients with signs of Doc_3187073_1013_1035_Disease than in those without in the pre-treatment evaluation.
3187073	10	1091	The most common signs of Doc_3187073_1116_1130_Disease were Doc_3187073_1136_1146_Disease, ST-T wave changes and Doc_3187073_1170_1189_Disease.

3192036	1	62	Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of Doc_3192036_175_190_Disease.
3192036	2	192	Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs.
3192036	3	360	The multiple drug schema consisted of: Doc_3192036_399_408_Chemical 16.213, Doc_3192036_417_429_Chemical, Doc_3192036_431_447_Chemical, Doc_3192036_449_460_Chemical, and Doc_3192036_466_475_Chemical.
3192036	4	477	On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Doc_3192036_534_546_Chemical, Doc_3192036_548_557_Chemical and Doc_3192036_562_578_Chemical were administered.
3192036	5	598	Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive Doc_3192036_701_722_Disease due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus.
3192036	6	799	Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive Doc_3192036_854_859_Disease Doc_3192036_860_868_Disease at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of Doc_3192036_961_966_Disease plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in Doc_3192036_1009_1014_Disease tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of Doc_3192036_1107_1112_Disease emboli.
3192036	7	1121	In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive Doc_3192036_1224_1232_Disease other explanations, such as spontaneous Doc_3192036_1273_1281_Disease, must be considered less likely.
3192036	8	1315	Patients with large Doc_3192036_1335_1347_Disease loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance.
3192036	9	1450	Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug.
3192036	10	1639	Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
322550	0	0	Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during Doc_322550_60_73_Chemical-induced Doc_322550_82_93_Disease.
322550	1	95	The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during Doc_322550_255_275_Chemical infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent.
322550	2	345	Before Doc_322550_352_365_Chemical infusion, 5 cm Doc_322550_381_384_Chemical CPAP significantly, P less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT.
322550	3	557	Ten cm Doc_322550_564_567_Chemical CPAP before Doc_322550_580_593_Chemical infusion produced a further Doc_322550_622_657_Disease and significantly increased heart rate and Doc_322550_701_725_Disease and QS/QT.
322550	4	737	Doc_322550_737_750_Chemical caused significant Doc_322550_770_806_Disease and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT.
322550	5	913	Five cm Doc_322550_921_924_Chemical CPAP during Doc_322550_937_950_Chemical did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables.
322550	6	1011	However, 10 cm Doc_322550_1026_1029_Chemical CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT.
322550	7	1097	These data indicate that Doc_322550_1122_1135_Chemical infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS/QT.
322550	8	1251	During Doc_322550_1258_1271_Chemical infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm Doc_322550_1378_1381_Chemical), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked Doc_322550_1423_1478_Disease.
3341566	0	0	Systolic pressure variation is greater during Doc_3341566_46_56_Disease than during Doc_3341566_69_89_Chemical-induced Doc_3341566_98_109_Disease in ventilated dogs.
3341566	1	130	The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to Doc_3341566_349_360_Disease.
3341566	2	362	Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by Doc_3341566_436_446_Disease (Doc_3341566_448_451_Disease, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of Doc_3341566_489_509_Chemical (Doc_3341566_511_514_Chemical, n = 7).
3341566	3	524	During Doc_3341566_531_534_Disease-induced Doc_3341566_543_554_Disease the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the Doc_3341566_664_667_Chemical group.
3341566	4	675	The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups.
3341566	5	791	Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups.
3341566	6	909	The SPV during Doc_3341566_924_935_Disease was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the Doc_3341566_966_969_Disease group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the Doc_3341566_1016_1019_Chemical group (P less than 0.02).
3341566	7	1046	The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the Doc_3341566_1176_1179_Disease and Doc_3341566_1184_1187_Chemical groups, respectively, during Doc_3341566_1217_1228_Disease (P less than 0.02).
3341566	8	1249	It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a Doc_3341566_1334_1345_Disease state due to a predominant decrease in preload.
3341566	9	1394	They are thus more important during absolute Doc_3341566_1439_1450_Disease than during deliberate Doc_3341566_1474_1485_Disease.

3358181	3	433	Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum Doc_3358181_505_514_Chemical level.
3358181	4	522	Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible.
3358181	5	595	Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of Doc_3358181_662_671_Chemical are advised.

3629586	4	589	A nonregenerative Doc_3629586_607_613_Disease was the most compromising of the Doc_3629586_647_657_Disease and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg Doc_3629586_724_733_Chemical or 540-840 mg/kg Doc_3629586_751_761_Chemical.
3629586	5	763	All three Doc_3629586_773_783_Disease were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days).
3629586	6	1007	Upon rechallenge with either Doc_3629586_1036_1049_Chemical, the Doc_3629586_1055_1075_Disease was reproduced in most dogs tested; Doc_3629586_1112_1121_Chemical (but not Doc_3629586_1131_1141_Chemical)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days).
3629586	7	1289	This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a Doc_3629586_1406_1415_Disease component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the Doc_3629586_1530_1539_Disease.
3629586	8	1541	We conclude that the administration of high doses of Doc_3629586_1594_1603_Chemical or Doc_3629586_1607_1617_Chemical to dogs can induce Doc_3629586_1637_1651_Disease similar to the Doc_3629586_1667_1680_Chemical-induced Doc_3629586_1689_1705_Disease described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.

3714122	0	0	The correlation between Doc_3714122_24_34_Disease esterase inhibition and Doc_3714122_59_66_Chemical-induced Doc_3714122_75_93_Disease in rats.
3714122	1	103	The correlation between Doc_3714122_127_145_Disease and inhibition of Doc_3714122_164_174_Disease esterase or Doc_3714122_187_197_Disease target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Doc_3714122_258_265_Chemical (Doc_3714122_267_310_Chemical), a Doc_3714122_315_325_Disease Doc_3714122_326_341_Chemical.
3714122	2	343	Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long-Evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of Doc_3714122_459_466_Chemical (ip, 1-15 mg/kg).
3714122	3	485	These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical Doc_3714122_548_559_Disease in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure.
3714122	4	638	Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats.
3714122	5	915	In contrast, dosages of Doc_3714122_939_946_Chemical (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of Doc_3714122_1114_1125_Disease in only 9% of the animals.
3714122	6	1153	These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after Doc_3714122_1265_1272_Chemical exposure can predict Doc_3714122_1294_1312_Disease in rats several weeks later.

3780846	1	105	The development of tolerance to the Doc_3780846_141_158_Disease produced by Doc_3780846_171_179_Chemical was studied in rats.
3780846	2	201	Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of Doc_3780846_249_257_Chemical (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced Doc_3780846_294_302_Disease recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram.
3780846	3	353	Rats treated for 11 days with Doc_3780846_383_391_Chemical and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a Doc_3780846_505_513_Disease after the test dose of Doc_3780846_537_545_Chemical that was not significantly less than in the controls and were Doc_3780846_608_616_Disease (A group).
3780846	4	628	The other rats showed a strong decrease in the Doc_3780846_675_683_Disease and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of Doc_3780846_760_768_Disease or Doc_3780846_772_784_Disease (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation.
3780846	5	859	The Doc_3780846_863_871_Disease was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment.
3780846	6	940	In a further series of experiments, Doc_3780846_976_987_Chemical (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the Doc_3780846_1116_1124_Disease without any dopaminergic interference.
3780846	7	1164	Doc_3780846_1164_1175_Chemical enhanced the Doc_3780846_1189_1197_Disease in the A group.
3780846	8	1214	However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group.
3780846	9	1301	The results suggest that Doc_3780846_1326_1334_Disease, which is assumed to be due to an action of Doc_3780846_1379_1387_Chemical in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum.
3780846	10	1495	Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect.
3780846	11	1558	The rapid alternations of Doc_3780846_1584_1592_Disease and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.

6133211	6	670	Despite reports to the contrary, it is suggested that Doc_6133211_724_738_Chemical may be teratogenic.
6203452	0	0	Doc_6203452_0_26_Disease and Doc_6203452_31_44_Disease associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy.
6203452	1	90	Five patients with Doc_6203452_109_118_Disease developed Doc_6203452_129_155_Disease (characterized by Doc_6203452_174_193_Disease, Doc_6203452_195_228_Disease, and usually Doc_6203452_242_258_Disease) after treatment with Doc_6203452_281_290_Chemical, Doc_6203452_292_301_Chemical, and a Doc_6203452_309_323_Chemical.
6203452	2	325	One patient had Doc_6203452_341_376_Disease, three the Doc_6203452_388_413_Disease, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders.
6203452	3	475	Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of Doc_6203452_537_562_Disease, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli.
6203452	4	631	Because each patient was Doc_6203452_656_661_Disease-free or had only a small Doc_6203452_687_692_Disease at the onset of this syndrome, the Doc_6203452_728_754_Disease may have been induced by chemotherapy.
6203452	5	794	Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because Doc_6203452_939_952_Disease may be ascribed to Doc_6203452_972_981_Chemical Doc_6203452_982_996_Disease and the Doc_6203452_1005_1011_Disease and Doc_6203452_1016_1032_Disease to drug-induced Doc_6203452_1049_1072_Disease.

6209318	1	112	Impact Research Group.
6209318	2	135	The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of Doc_6209318_195_205_Chemical (Doc_6209318_207_225_Chemical) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented Doc_6209318_313_334_Disease.
6209318	3	336	The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording.
6209318	4	697	Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the Doc_6209318_767_777_Chemical and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12.
6209318	5	888	These differences were observed even though the serum Doc_6209318_942_952_Chemical levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug.
6209318	6	1080	There were more Doc_6209318_1096_1102_Disease in the Doc_6209318_1110_1120_Chemical group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant.
6209318	7	1218	The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups.
6209318	8	1279	Previously recognized side effects, particularly Doc_6209318_1328_1334_Disease and Doc_6209318_1339_1364_Disease, were more frequent in the Doc_6209318_1392_1402_Chemical group than in the placebo group.
6229975	0	0	Changes in heart size during long-term Doc_6229975_39_46_Chemical treatment after Doc_6229975_63_84_Disease.
6229975	1	86	The effect of long-term Doc_6229975_110_117_Chemical treatment on heart size after Doc_6229975_148_169_Disease was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, Doc_6229975_254_261_Chemical 115).
6229975	2	268	The follow-up period was 12 months.
6229975	3	304	The Doc_6229975_308_315_Chemical-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group.
6229975	4	449	These differences may be caused by Doc_6229975_484_491_Chemical-induced Doc_6229975_500_511_Disease and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume.
6229975	5	565	The Doc_6229975_569_576_Chemical-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size.
6229975	6	677	In patients with Doc_6229975_694_706_Disease, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups.
6229975	7	763	After re-Doc_6229975_772_782_Disease, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the Doc_6229975_856_863_Chemical group.
6286738	0	0	Doc_6286738_0_10_Chemical Doc_6286738_11_19_Disease in dairy cows.
6286738	1	35	Large parenteral doses of Doc_6286738_61_71_Chemical (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU Doc_6286738_95_105_Chemical) were associated with prolonged Doc_6286738_138_151_Disease, Doc_6286738_153_170_Disease, and large increases of Doc_6286738_195_205_Chemical and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows.
6286738	2	300	Doc_6286738_300_307_Chemical concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with Doc_6286738_373_383_Chemical about 32 days prepartum (8.8 mg/100 ml) than in control cows (5.5 mg/100 ml).
6286738	3	462	None of the cows treated with Doc_6286738_492_502_Chemical showed signs of Doc_6286738_519_529_Disease during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of Doc_6286738_621_631_Disease during this period.
6286738	4	652	Signs of Doc_6286738_661_671_Chemical Doc_6286738_672_680_Disease were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of Doc_6286738_791_801_Chemical Doc_6286738_802_810_Disease and 10 of 17 cows died.
6286738	5	835	There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died.
6286738	6	904	Because of the extreme Doc_6286738_927_935_Disease of Doc_6286738_939_949_Chemical in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of Doc_6286738_1020_1030_Chemical that prevent Doc_6286738_1044_1054_Disease and doses that induce Doc_6286738_1077_1087_Disease, we concluded that Doc_6286738_1107_1117_Chemical cannot be used practically to prevent Doc_6286738_1156_1166_Disease when injected several weeks prepartum.
6287825	0	0	Doc_6287825_0_29_Disease as seen in the Nigerian African.

6287825	3	305	Doc_6287825_305_329_Disease was the commonest presentation (50%).
6287825	4	368	Doc_6287825_368_392_Disease was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with Doc_6287825_477_493_Disease.
6287825	5	495	Doc_6287825_495_516_Disease due to Doc_6287825_524_546_Disease of Doc_6287825_550_558_Chemical and Doc_6287825_563_573_Chemical was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and Doc_6287825_629_653_Disease.
6287825	6	655	Doc_6287825_655_672_Disease was the major cause of Doc_6287825_696_716_Disease.
6287825	7	718	Doc_6287825_718_727_Chemical was the most frequent agent in drug-induced Doc_6287825_772_782_Disease.
6287825	8	784	Doc_6287825_784_792_Disease (20%) was not an uncommon cause of Doc_6287825_828_846_Disease although Doc_6287825_856_868_Disease arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%).
6287825	9	982	In 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the Doc_6287825_1030_1040_Disease was undetermined.
6287825	10	1059	Heredofamilial and Doc_6287825_1078_1105_Disease were rare.
6287825	11	1117	Some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the Doc_6287825_1198_1210_Disease are briefly discussed.
6308277	0	0	Reduction in Doc_6308277_13_21_Chemical Doc_6308277_22_30_Disease by Doc_6308277_34_47_Chemical.
6308277	1	49	A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing Doc_6308277_138_161_Chemical, Doc_6308277_163_171_Chemical, and Doc_6308277_177_190_Chemical displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of Doc_6308277_274_282_Chemical per mL of serum.
6308277	2	300	Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of Doc_6308277_377_385_Chemical on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of Doc_6308277_460_473_Chemical (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS Doc_6308277_509_517_Disease of Doc_6308277_521_529_Chemical.
6308277	3	531	Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with Doc_6308277_588_601_Chemical (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of Doc_6308277_667_675_Chemical (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal Doc_6308277_721_732_Disease by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with Doc_6308277_784_797_Chemical (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic Doc_6308277_845_853_Disease produced in the presence of Doc_6308277_882_890_Chemical (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP).
6308277	4	914	The frequency of sound-induced Doc_6308277_945_953_Disease after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg Doc_6308277_977_985_Chemical was reduced from 50 to 5% by Doc_6308277_1015_1028_Chemical.
6308277	5	1030	In the absence of Doc_6308277_1048_1056_Chemical, Doc_6308277_1058_1071_Chemical (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the Doc_6308277_1109_1117_Disease induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of Doc_6308277_1191_1208_Chemical in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS).
6308277	6	1286	Doc_6308277_1286_1299_Chemical (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive Doc_6308277_1374_1383_Chemical into Doc_6308277_1389_1392_Chemical in slices of rat cerebral cortex.
6308277	7	1427	Thus the mechanism by which Doc_6308277_1455_1468_Chemical antagonizes the actions of Doc_6308277_1496_1504_Chemical in the CNS remains unknown.
6386793	0	0	A double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of Doc_6386793_51_74_Chemical in the treatment of major Doc_6386793_101_120_Disease.
6386793	1	122	In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, Doc_6386793_173_182_Chemical and Doc_6386793_187_200_Chemical were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 Doc_6386793_249_258_Disease outpatients.
6386793	2	272	Doc_6386793_272_281_Chemical and Doc_6386793_286_299_Chemical were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of Doc_6386793_354_372_Disease, and both were significantly superior to placebo.
6386793	3	423	The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of Doc_6386793_495_509_Disease, Doc_6386793_511_520_Disease, and drowsiness were significantly less with Doc_6386793_566_575_Chemical than with Doc_6386793_586_599_Chemical.
6386793	4	601	Doc_6386793_601_610_Chemical also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects.

6666578	3	269	Pair fed rats served as controls.
6666578	4	303	Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM).
6666578	5	400	In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA).
6666578	6	600	TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of Doc_6666578_659_664_Chemical-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation.
6666578	7	740	In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells.
6666578	8	972	The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with Doc_6666578_1103_1108_Chemical for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant Doc_6666578_1236_1247_Chemical.
6666578	9	1249	The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by Doc_6666578_1298_1303_Chemical, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by Doc_6666578_1561_1566_Chemical treatment.
6666578	10	1578	These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of Doc_6666578_1654_1659_Chemical may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.

6692345	3	627	Doc_6692345_627_632_Chemical-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by Doc_6692345_707_714_Chemical co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks.
6692345	4	771	In the forestomach, and also in the liver, Doc_6692345_814_821_Chemical did not affect the Doc_6692345_841_846_Chemical-induced increase in labeling index.
6692345	5	883	The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in Doc_6692345_1007_1012_Chemical Doc_6692345_1013_1027_Disease in the bladder and forestomach, and that Doc_6692345_1069_1076_Chemical's effect on Doc_6692345_1089_1094_Chemical in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation.

6888657	7	1287	Increased density and/or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols.
6888657	8	1431	All these effects of Doc_6888657_1452_1455_Chemical were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals.
6888657	9	1518	The data extend the findings of other investigators, further establishing the Doc_6888657_1596_1599_Chemical-induced Doc_6888657_1608_1613_Disease as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms.
7053303	0	0	Age and renal clearance of Doc_7053303_27_37_Chemical.
7053303	1	39	In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving Doc_7053303_83_93_Chemical therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of Doc_7053303_195_205_Chemical by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for Doc_7053303_253_263_Chemical.
7053303	2	265	Doc_7053303_265_275_Chemical clearance decreased with age.
7053303	3	306	The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of Doc_7053303_351_361_Chemical per unit dose, after intravenous Doc_7053303_395_405_Chemical, increased with age of the patients.
7053303	4	443	The ratio of Doc_7053303_456_466_Chemical clearance to Doc_7053303_480_490_Chemical clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for Doc_7053303_565_575_Chemical.
7053303	5	577	Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of Doc_7053303_665_675_Chemical, suggesting that secretion of Doc_7053303_706_716_Chemical is a saturable process.
7053303	6	741	There was only one case of Doc_7053303_768_776_Disease possibly due to Doc_7053303_793_803_Chemical (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without Doc_7053303_896_919_Disease who had Doc_7053303_928_938_Chemical levels above 1.25 microgram/ml.
7053303	7	971	Thus, high Doc_7053303_982_992_Chemical levels alone do not always induce Doc_7053303_1027_1035_Disease.

7088431	2	228	One patient, aged 23, had been followed for 2 years before Doc_7088431_287_296_Disease was diagnosed; the second patient, aged 22, had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years, 8 months.
7088431	3	397	In both instances, suspicion of the presence of Doc_7088431_445_454_Disease was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix.
7088431	4	525	Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and, in 1 instance, an abnormal x-ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen.
7199841	0	0	Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of Doc_7199841_53_72_Chemical, Doc_7199841_74_85_Chemical, and low pH normal saline in dogs.
7199841	1	121	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of Doc_7199841_248_267_Chemical in experimental animals.
7199841	2	293	The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing Doc_7199841_377_390_Disease was evaluated.
7199841	3	406	The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows: 6 to 8 ml of Doc_7199841_502_513_Chemical (N = 15), Doc_7199841_524_543_Chemical (N = 20), low pH normal saline (pH 3.0) (N = 20), or normal saline (N = 10).
7199841	4	621	Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of Doc_7199841_679_698_Chemical seven (35%) developed hind-limb Doc_7199841_731_740_Disease.
7199841	5	742	None of the animals that received Doc_7199841_776_787_Chemical, normal saline, or normal saline titrated to a pH 3.0 developed hind-limb Doc_7199841_862_871_Disease.
7199841	6	873	Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received Doc_7199841_925_944_Chemical, 13 showed Doc_7199841_956_972_Disease; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal.
7199841	7	1028	The spinal cords of the animals that received Doc_7199841_1074_1085_Chemical, low pH normal saline (pH 3.0), or normal saline did not show abnormal findings.

7234705	1	59	Seven cases of Doc_7234705_74_86_Chemical-induced polymorphous Doc_7234705_108_131_Disease are presented.
7234705	2	147	In four patients, polymorphous Doc_7234705_178_201_Disease appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of Doc_7234705_264_276_Chemical for the treatment of sustained Doc_7234705_308_331_Disease.
7234705	3	333	In the remaining three patients, Doc_7234705_366_378_Chemical was administered orally for treatment of chronic Doc_7234705_428_462_Disease or Doc_7234705_466_480_Disease.
7234705	4	482	These patients had Doc_7234705_501_517_Disease and recurrent Doc_7234705_532_539_Disease due to polymorphous Doc_7234705_560_583_Disease.
7234705	5	585	In four patients, the Doc_7234705_607_617_Disease was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the Doc_7234705_698_708_Disease.
7234705	6	710	In two patients, the Doc_7234705_731_741_Disease degenerated into irreversible Doc_7234705_772_796_Disease and both patients died.
7234705	7	821	In the seventh patient, a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and, despite continuation of Doc_7234705_921_933_Chemical therapy, polymorphous Doc_7234705_956_979_Disease did not reoccur.
7234705	8	997	These seven cases demonstrate that Doc_7234705_1032_1044_Chemical can produce an acquired Doc_7234705_1069_1091_Disease with polymorphous Doc_7234705_1110_1133_Disease.

7248170	1	120	The yield of severe Doc_7248170_140_162_Disease (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, Doc_7248170_236_243_Disease greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, Doc_7248170_299_311_Disease 2-3 times normal, and testicular Doc_7248170_345_352_Disease approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of Doc_7248170_405_425_Chemical given intragastrically in the Doc_7248170_456_470_Chemical-primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of Doc_7248170_556_576_Chemical at the peak of the Doc_7248170_596_610_Chemical-induced Doc_7248170_619_643_Disease.
7248170	2	645	At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P450/Doc_7248170_699_703_Chemical toxic state was both maximal and stable.
7248170	3	745	The optimal rat size to begin Doc_7248170_775_789_Chemical was determined as 100 g, and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47% greater than normal rats of the same body weight.
7248170	4	944	The optimal time for the initial dose of Doc_7248170_985_1005_Chemical was after 14 days on Doc_7248170_1027_1041_Chemical.

7292072	2	142	Unusual features of the Doc_7292072_166_176_Disease are repetitive group beating, progressive shortening of the R-R interval, progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction, and changes in direction of the QRS axis.
7292072	3	387	Recognition of variant Doc_7292072_410_433_Disease is important because therapy differs from that of classic Doc_7292072_492_515_Disease.

7352670	1	80	The role of the renin--Doc_7352670_103_114_Chemical system in the maintenance of blood pressure during Doc_7352670_166_175_Chemical anesthesia and Doc_7352670_191_211_Chemical (Doc_7352670_213_216_Chemical)-induced Doc_7352670_226_237_Disease was evaluated.
7352670	2	253	Control rats received Doc_7352670_275_284_Chemical anesthesia (1 MAC) for one hour, followed by Doc_7352670_330_333_Chemical infusion, 40 microgram/kg/min, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min recovery period.
7352670	3	415	A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of Doc_7352670_504_513_Chemical (a competitive inhibitor of Doc_7352670_542_556_Chemical) throughout the experimental period.
7352670	4	594	In each group, Doc_7352670_609_612_Chemical infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr.
7352670	5	724	During the Doc_7352670_735_738_Chemical infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive Doc_7352670_795_821_Disease to 61 torr, whereas the Doc_7352670_846_855_Chemical-treated animals showed no change.
7352670	6	890	Following discontinuation of Doc_7352670_919_922_Chemical, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the Doc_7352670_1016_1025_Chemical-treated rats.
7352670	7	1040	This study indicates that with stable Doc_7352670_1078_1087_Chemical anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during Doc_7352670_1146_1149_Chemical infusion and the post-Doc_7352670_1172_1175_Chemical rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by Doc_7352670_1231_1240_Chemical.
7352670	8	1242	This demonstrates the participation of the renin--Doc_7352670_1292_1303_Chemical system in antagonizing the combined Doc_7352670_1340_1351_Disease effects of Doc_7352670_1363_1372_Chemical and Doc_7352670_1377_1380_Chemical.

7420681	1	54	A prospective study.
7420681	2	75	Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive Doc_7420681_125_139_Chemical antibiotics annually.
7420681	3	162	Doc_7420681_162_180_Chemical and Doc_7420681_185_203_Chemical continue to demonstrate Doc_7420681_228_239_Disease and Doc_7420681_244_258_Disease in both animal and clinical studies.
7420681	4	296	In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of Doc_7420681_405_423_Chemical or Doc_7420681_427_445_Chemical for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of Doc_7420681_528_542_Chemical-related Doc_7420681_551_564_Disease, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function.
7420681	5	627	In these 62 patients, no other causes for Doc_7420681_669_682_Disease could be identified.
7420681	6	704	Five of 33 (15%) of the Doc_7420681_728_738_Chemical-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the Doc_7420681_784_794_Chemical-treated patients had Doc_7420681_816_829_Disease.
7420681	7	831	Thus, Doc_7420681_837_847_Chemical was associated with Doc_7420681_868_881_Disease more than three times as often as was Doc_7420681_920_930_Chemical.

7423039	1	52	The Doc_7423039_56_67_Disease effects of Doc_7423039_79_89_Chemical were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system.
7423039	2	163	Doc_7423039_163_173_Chemical inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture.
7423039	3	273	A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and Doc_7423039_393_411_Chemical mole fraction were determined in the Doc_7423039_449_459_Chemical-treated cells.
7423039	4	475	The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the Doc_7423039_554_571_Chemical mole fraction was unchanged.
7423039	5	601	Such disparity suggests an inhibition of Doc_7423039_642_650_Chemical phosphokinase.
7423039	6	666	The addition of 1 mM Doc_7423039_687_696_Chemical to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the Doc_7423039_752_755_Chemical concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized Doc_7423039_830_833_Chemical pool.
7423039	7	840	In the Doc_7423039_847_857_Chemical-treated cells, the addition of Doc_7423039_889_898_Chemical increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.

7444978	2	205	Beginning at 8 days of age, body movement and hearing were examined for 6 and up to 17 weeks, respectively.
7444978	3	313	Doc_7444978_313_331_Disease and Doc_7444978_336_344_Disease occurred only in rats treated during the preweaning period; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11-17 and 5 to 11 days of age, respectively, indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to Doc_7444978_588_600_Chemical than the site (vestibular or central) responsible for the Doc_7444978_659_670_Disease.
7449470	0	0	Late, late Doc_7449470_11_22_Chemical Doc_7449470_23_37_Disease.
7449470	1	39	Doc_7449470_39_55_Disease is a major complication which limits the use of Doc_7449470_104_114_Chemical as a chemotherapeutic agent.
7449470	2	144	Doc_7449470_144_158_Disease is frequent when the total dose exceeds 600 mg/m2 and occurs within one to six months after cessation of therapy.
7449470	3	273	A patient is reported who developed progressive Doc_7449470_321_335_Disease two and one-half years after receiving 580 mg/m2 which apparently represents late, late Doc_7449470_424_438_Disease.

7453952	2	305	Doc_7453952_305_314_Chemical reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of Doc_7453952_453_462_Chemical, a reduction was observed in the Doc_7453952_496_503_Chemical content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied.
7453952	3	570	At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in Doc_7453952_623_630_Chemical levels.
7453952	4	639	After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue Doc_7453952_715_722_Chemical levels accompanied a reduction in water intake.
7453952	5	771	In all the experiments, the attenuation of the Doc_7453952_818_825_Chemical-induced Doc_7453952_834_866_Disease by Doc_7453952_870_879_Chemical was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the Doc_7453952_936_943_Chemical concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma Doc_7453952_1038_1047_Chemical level.

7504976	1	135	This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of Doc_7504976_199_222_Disease encountered with antithyroid drugs.
7504976	2	259	Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with Doc_7504976_329_344_Disease admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992.
7504976	3	413	Four patients (1.7%) were identified with Doc_7504976_464_479_Disease which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent.
7504976	4	550	Two patients had a Doc_7504976_569_590_Disease induced by Doc_7504976_602_613_Chemical (Doc_7504976_615_628_Chemical).

7516729	2	301	Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM Doc_7516729_422_424_Chemical and 1.35 mM Doc_7516729_437_439_Chemical (N).
7516729	3	445	It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [Doc_7516729_484_486_Chemical]o to 78 mM (LNa), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [Doc_7516729_543_545_Chemical]o to 78 mM and [Doc_7516729_562_564_Chemical]o to 0.675 mM (LNa+LCa) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [Doc_7516729_616_618_Chemical]o to 78 mM plus increasing [Doc_7516729_647_649_Chemical]o to 3.6 mM (LNa+HCa).
7516729	4	673	At normal [Doc_7516729_684_686_Chemical]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [Doc_7516729_735_737_Chemical]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [Doc_7516729_805_807_Chemical]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%.
7516729	5	852	All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent.
7516729	6	905	Dose-dependent Doc_7516729_920_931_Disease induced by Doc_7516729_943_952_Chemical was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa.
7516729	7	991	Independent but not additive effects of Doc_7516729_1031_1033_Chemical and Doc_7516729_1038_1040_Chemical are shown by decreases in the values of [Doc_7516729_1082_1091_Chemical]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa.
7516729	8	1231	The [Doc_7516729_1236_1245_Chemical]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N.
7516729	9	1359	The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [Doc_7516729_1438_1440_Chemical]o than on [Doc_7516729_1452_1454_Chemical]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration.

7582165	2	180	A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented Doc_7582165_244_253_Disease (patients 1 and 2) and Doc_7582165_277_291_Disease (patient 1).
7582165	3	305	The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid.
7582165	4	499	Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different Doc_7582165_577_592_Chemical and ELISA tests were performed.
7582165	5	625	In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with Doc_7582165_672_685_Chemical were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients.
7582165	6	752	A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients.
7582165	7	911	We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other Doc_7582165_973_988_Chemical and found intolerance to some of them.
7582165	8	1028	These results suggest that Doc_7582165_1055_1068_Chemical caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients.

7919560	2	181	CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy was treated with Doc_7919560_230_240_Chemical and Doc_7919560_245_255_Chemical because of suspected Doc_7919560_277_287_Disease.
7919560	3	289	Medications were discontinued when Doc_7919560_324_343_Disease and Doc_7919560_348_372_Disease caused by Doc_7919560_383_394_Disease occurred.
7919560	4	405	The patient was treated with Doc_7919560_434_452_Chemical and gradually improved.
7919560	5	477	Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with Doc_7919560_525_535_Chemical was positive.
7919560	6	550	After most Doc_7919560_573_583_Disease causing Doc_7919560_592_611_Disease and Doc_7919560_616_627_Disease were ruled out, a Doc_7919560_646_676_Disease was suspected.
7919560	7	692	Positive MIF test for Doc_7919560_714_724_Chemical showed sensitization of the patient's lymphocytes to Doc_7919560_778_788_Chemical.
7919560	8	790	Doc_7919560_803_831_Disease is a rare and dangerous manifestation of Doc_7919560_873_880_Disease to Doc_7919560_884_895_Chemical.
7930386	0	0	Doc_7930386_0_12_Chemical-induced Doc_7930386_21_38_Disease does not impair its prolactin-releasing action.
7930386	1	87	The present study was undertaken to examine the role of Doc_7930386_143_160_Disease, induced by Doc_7930386_173_185_Chemical administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect.
7930386	2	282	Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo-controlled conditions, one during the night, when sleeping (n = 7) and the other at daytime, when awake (n = 6).
7930386	3	452	Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of Doc_7930386_497_509_Chemical given orally 2 hours before blood collection.
7930386	4	556	Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure.
7930386	5	688	For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion, acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values.
7930386	6	910	During the night Doc_7930386_927_939_Chemical ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness.
7930386	7	1078	As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies (46 +/- 19% vs 34 +/- 10%), it can be concluded that the observed Doc_7930386_1292_1309_Disease did not interfere with the drug action per se.
7930386	8	1357	The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency, as, for both, mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior Doc_7930386_1548_1560_Chemical ingestion.

7977601	2	152	We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of Doc_7977601_213_230_Chemical to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the Doc_7977601_360_377_Chemical fundus camera.
7977601	3	393	Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 Doc_7977601_476_493_Chemical angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992.
7977601	4	571	Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous Doc_7977601_618_635_Chemical testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions.
7977601	5	693	For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing.
7977601	6	807	The dosage of Doc_7977601_821_838_Chemical used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution.
7977601	7	917	There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as Doc_7977601_1008_1014_Disease, Doc_7977601_1016_1025_Disease, Doc_7977601_1027_1037_Disease, Doc_7977601_1039_1048_Disease, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment.
7977601	8	1106	Also recorded were one case of Doc_7977601_1137_1141_Disease of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of Doc_7977601_1198_1209_Disease.
7977601	9	1211	The two Doc_7977601_1219_1230_Disease patients required treatment for Doc_7977601_1263_1268_Disease.

8073369	1	50	Doc_8073369_50_57_Chemical, an alkaloid from Conium maculatum (poison hemlock), has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock.
8073369	2	158	The major teratogenic outcome is Doc_8073369_191_205_Disease, presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade.
8073369	3	254	However, Doc_8073369_263_270_Chemical has failed to produce Doc_8073369_293_307_Disease in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits.
8073369	4	367	The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of Doc_8073369_436_443_Chemical and Doc_8073369_448_456_Chemical in the developing chick.
8073369	5	482	Concentrations of Doc_8073369_500_507_Chemical and Doc_8073369_512_520_Chemical sulfate were 0.015%, 0.03%, 0.075%, 0.15%, 0.75%, 1.5%, 3%, and 6% and 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively.
8073369	6	623	Both compounds caused Doc_8073369_645_657_Disease and lethality in a dose-dependent manner.
8073369	7	700	All concentrations of Doc_8073369_722_730_Chemical sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for Doc_8073369_787_794_Chemical lethality was 0.75%.
8073369	8	816	The Doc_8073369_820_832_Disease caused by both Doc_8073369_848_855_Chemical and Doc_8073369_860_868_Chemical sulfate were Doc_8073369_882_932_Disease.
8073369	9	934	No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive Doc_8073369_1080_1098_Disease occurred in all Doc_8073369_1115_1123_Chemical sulfate-treated chicks.
8073369	10	1148	There was a statistically significant (P < or = 0.01) decrease in movement in Doc_8073369_1226_1233_Chemical and Doc_8073369_1238_1246_Chemical sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound.
8073369	11	1299	Control chicks were in motion an average of 33.67% of the time, while Doc_8073369_1369_1376_Chemical-treated chicks were only moving 8.95% of a 5-min interval, and no movement was observed for Doc_8073369_1469_1477_Chemical sulfate treated chicks.
8073369	12	1502	In summary, the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of Doc_8073369_1591_1598_Chemical-induced Doc_8073369_1607_1621_Disease.
8073369	13	1623	Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement.

8372922	1	86	Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area (A1) of primate cortex.
8372922	2	186	In A1 of macaque monkeys, low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially.
8372922	3	312	The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear Doc_8372922_422_434_Disease.
8372922	4	436	Under anesthesia, the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed, and the tonotopic organization of A1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques.
8372922	5	624	Following recovery, the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using Doc_8372922_709_718_Chemical and Doc_8372922_723_733_Chemical.
8372922	6	735	The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone-burst elicited auditory brainstem responses.
8372922	7	848	Three months after deafening, A1 was remapped.
8372922	8	895	Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data.
8372922	9	998	The results indicate that the deprived area of A1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies.

8421099	1	160	This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active Doc_8421099_280_290_Disease treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog Doc_8421099_344_354_Chemical in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months.
8421099	2	429	During treatment with Doc_8421099_451_461_Chemical, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had Doc_8421099_500_510_Disease, and 1 developed Doc_8421099_528_547_Disease requiring surgery.
8421099	3	567	In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection.
8421099	4	687	In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained Doc_8421099_759_768_Disease throughout therapy.
8421099	5	789	After withdrawal of Doc_8421099_809_819_Chemical in 10 patients without Doc_8421099_843_853_Disease, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month.
8421099	6	938	In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed Doc_8421099_986_996_Disease during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained Doc_8421099_1141_1150_Disease in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months).
8421099	7	1200	Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, Doc_8421099_1327_1337_Disease, and Doc_8421099_1343_1356_Disease during Doc_8421099_1364_1374_Chemical therapy in Chinese Doc_8421099_1394_1405_Disease patients.

8643971	1	118	Improved outcomes among patients with Doc_8643971_156_180_Disease require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy.
8643971	2	240	Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent Doc_8643971_323_333_Chemical (Doc_8643971_335_340_Chemical; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with Doc_8643971_433_453_Disease, and the Doc_8643971_463_473_Chemical/Doc_8643971_474_483_Chemical combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in Doc_8643971_582_596_Disease patients.
8643971	3	607	We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and Doc_8643971_669_677_Disease of escalating Doc_8643971_692_702_Chemical doses combined with fixed-dose Doc_8643971_734_743_Chemical with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable Doc_8643971_850_873_Disease.
8643971	4	875	To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial.
8643971	5	973	Primary Doc_8643971_981_986_Disease sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each.
8643971	6	1143	Of 20 patients evaluable for Doc_8643971_1172_1180_Disease, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease.
8643971	7	1230	Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of Doc_8643971_1305_1315_Chemical by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of Doc_8643971_1376_1385_Chemical (75 mg/m2).
8643971	8	1398	The dose levels incorporate escalating Doc_8643971_1437_1447_Chemical doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if Doc_8643971_1527_1535_Disease permits.
8643971	9	1545	At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable.
8643971	10	1679	With Doc_8643971_1684_1694_Chemical doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12).
8643971	11	1812	Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response.
8643971	12	1935	Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two.
8643971	13	1995	The overall response rate is 72%.
8643971	14	2029	Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy.
8643971	15	2117	Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses.

8649546	1	82	Seven patients suffering from Doc_8649546_112_131_Disease (Doc_8649546_133_135_Disease) with severely disabling Doc_8649546_161_171_Disease received low-dose Doc_8649546_190_201_Chemical as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment.
8649546	2	257	There was a significant 40% improvement in the Doc_8649546_304_314_Disease score without increase of Doc_8649546_341_353_Disease Doc_8649546_354_370_Disease.
8649546	3	372	Ballistic and choreic Doc_8649546_394_404_Disease were markedly ameliorated, whereas Doc_8649546_440_448_Disease was not.
8649546	4	458	This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta-blockers may improve Doc_8649546_540_548_Chemical-induced ballistic and choreic Doc_8649546_579_589_Disease in Doc_8649546_593_595_Disease.
8669433	0	0	Habitual use of Doc_8669433_16_29_Chemical as a risk factor for Doc_8669433_51_72_Disease: a comparison with Doc_8669433_92_102_Chemical.
8669433	1	104	Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of Doc_8669433_192_202_Chemical is associated with the development of Doc_8669433_241_262_Disease and Doc_8669433_267_290_Disease (Doc_8669433_292_296_Disease), with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19.
8669433	2	345	As a result of these and other studies, Doc_8669433_385_395_Chemical has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries.
8669433	3	454	However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of Doc_8669433_592_605_Chemical is also associated with Doc_8669433_630_651_Disease and Doc_8669433_656_660_Disease, with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4.
8669433	4	707	These studies suggest that both Doc_8669433_739_749_Chemical and Doc_8669433_754_767_Chemical may contribute to the burden of Doc_8669433_800_804_Disease, with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former.
8669433	5	879	This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in Doc_8669433_945_956_Disease potential of the drugs themselves.
8669433	6	992	A lower relative risk would be expected for Doc_8669433_1036_1049_Chemical if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone.
8669433	7	1161	Thus, Doc_8669433_1167_1180_Chemical has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics, whereas Doc_8669433_1268_1278_Chemical was available only in combinations.
8669433	8	1315	The possibility that habitual use of Doc_8669433_1352_1365_Chemical alone increases the risk of Doc_8669433_1394_1398_Disease has not been clearly demonstrated, but cannot be dismissed.

8682684	1	35	Through 30 years of widespread use, Doc_8682684_71_84_Chemical has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages.
8682684	2	159	The potential for Doc_8682684_177_190_Chemical to produce Doc_8682684_202_227_Disease is very low.
8682684	3	241	However, Doc_8682684_250_263_Chemical has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of Doc_8682684_309_320_Disease, including Doc_8682684_332_343_Disease, in sensitive individuals.
8682684	4	371	This article describes two Doc_8682684_398_412_Disease patients in whom transient episodes of Doc_8682684_452_463_Disease reproducibly developed after administration of Doc_8682684_511_524_Chemical.
8682684	5	526	Other symptoms of Doc_8682684_544_562_Disease were not clinically detectable.
8682684	6	595	The Doc_8682684_599_610_Disease episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration.
8682684	7	678	The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider Doc_8682684_737_750_Chemical in patients with Doc_8682684_768_779_Disease of unknown origin.
8690168	0	0	Reduction of Doc_8690168_13_29_Chemical-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with Doc_8690168_104_118_Chemical-induced Doc_8690168_127_147_Disease.
8690168	1	149	Doc_8690168_149_165_Chemical-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of Doc_8690168_276_284_Disease by Doc_8690168_288_302_Chemical and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye Doc_8690168_372_387_Chemical.
8690168	2	389	Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor.
8690168	3	492	The Doc_8690168_496_512_Chemical specificity of the Doc_8690168_532_547_Chemical staining was demonstrated by Doc_8690168_577_594_Chemical-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect.
8690168	4	740	The majority of anionic sites (74% in Doc_8690168_778_786_Disease and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.
8690168	5	891	A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for Doc_8690168_1116_1124_Disease and control rats, respectively).
8690168	6	1158	Doc_8690168_1158_1166_Disease rats progressively developed Doc_8690168_1196_1207_Disease reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002).
8690168	7	1326	At the same time, the number of Doc_8690168_1358_1374_Chemical anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively.
8690168	8	1605	Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed.
8690168	9	1772	We conclude that in Doc_8690168_1792_1806_Chemical-Doc_8690168_1807_1815_Disease rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced Doc_8690168_1876_1892_Chemical charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.

869641	1	97	Doc_869641_97_103_Chemical (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with Doc_869641_209_215_Chemical (25 mg/kg i.v.) in anesthetize Doc_869641_247_250_Chemical-inhibited dogs.
869641	2	267	In addition, reflex Doc_869641_287_298_Disease caused by injected Doc_869641_318_332_Chemical was significantly enhanced by Doc_869641_363_369_Chemical, Doc_869641_371_401_Chemical had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to Doc_869641_469_483_Chemical.
869641	3	485	Doc_869641_485_491_Chemical, a Doc_869641_495_503_Chemical-beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the Doc_869641_559_570_Disease, Doc_869641_572_583_Disease or reflex-enhancing effect of Doc_869641_614_620_Chemical.
869641	4	622	Doc_869641_622_630_Chemical did not affect the actions of Doc_869641_661_667_Chemical on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes.
869641	5	753	Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of Doc_869641_884_898_Chemical.
869641	6	900	However, Doc_869641_909_915_Chemical restored the Doc_869641_929_940_Disease caused by Doc_869641_951_965_Chemical in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. Doc_869641_1023_1028_Chemical (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex Doc_869641_1109_1120_Disease to Doc_869641_1124_1138_Chemical.
869641	7	1140	It is concluded that Doc_869641_1161_1167_Chemical enhances reflex Doc_869641_1184_1195_Disease through central alpha-receptor stimulation.
869641	8	1240	Furthermore, the effects are mediated through Doc_869641_1286_1294_Chemical rather than Doc_869641_1307_1321_Chemical and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors.

8701950	2	204	In both cases, discontinuation of Doc_8701950_238_243_Chemical and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, Doc_8701950_313_328_Chemical, Doc_8701950_330_337_Chemical, and Doc_8701950_343_355_Chemical led to resolution of Doc_8701950_377_381_Disease.
8701950	3	383	In one patient, reintroduction of Doc_8701950_417_422_Chemical led to rapid recurrence of Doc_8701950_450_454_Disease.
8701950	4	456	Doc_8701950_456_461_Chemical-associated Doc_8701950_473_477_Disease is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication.
8701950	5	553	In our experience and according to the literature, Doc_8701950_604_609_Chemical does not seem to cross-react with Doc_8701950_644_657_Chemical (Doc_8701950_659_662_Chemical), an immuno-suppressive drug already known to induce Doc_8701950_716_720_Disease.

8741744	0	0	The interpeduncular nucleus regulates Doc_8741744_38_46_Chemical's effects on free-field activity.
8741744	1	81	Partial lesions were made with Doc_8741744_112_123_Chemical in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat.
8741744	2	191	Compared with sham-operated controls, lesions significantly (p < 0.25) blunted the early (<60 min) free-field Doc_8741744_301_323_Disease caused by Doc_8741744_334_342_Chemical (0.5 mg kg(-1), i.m.), enhanced the later (60-120 min) Doc_8741744_398_406_Chemical-induced Doc_8741744_415_428_Disease, and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity.
8741744	3	473	Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for Doc_8741744_535_542_Chemical acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus (p <0.025), but not for Doc_8741744_616_624_Chemical hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A10 region.
8741744	4	686	We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic Doc_8741744_750_760_Disease of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain.

8752018	6	914	In this preliminary report, Doc_8752018_954_971_Chemical was a superior alternative to Doc_8752018_1002_1009_Chemical in Doc_8752018_1013_1020_Disease patients experiencing Doc_8752018_1043_1061_Disease, Doc_8752018_1063_1081_Disease, and Doc_8752018_1087_1109_Disease.
8829025	0	0	Effect of Doc_8829025_10_20_Chemical on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving Doc_8829025_80_90_Chemical.
8829025	1	92	The effect of Doc_8829025_106_116_Chemical on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving Doc_8829025_185_195_Chemical was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996.
8829025	2	249	Two groups of patients receiving Doc_8829025_282_292_Chemical were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising Doc_8829025_353_365_Disease patients who were receiving Doc_8829025_394_404_Chemical, and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving Doc_8829025_470_480_Chemical.
8829025	3	482	The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients.
8829025	4	548	Doc_8829025_548_558_Chemical significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum Doc_8829025_646_656_Chemical levels at 6 and 12 months.
8829025	5	684	The observed positive impact of Doc_8829025_716_726_Chemical on reducing the Doc_8829025_743_757_Disease associated with Doc_8829025_774_784_Chemical in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat Doc_8829025_877_889_Disease in this population.
88336	0	0	Alpha and beta Doc_88336_15_19_Disease in drug intoxication uncomplicated by Doc_88336_58_74_Disease.
88336	1	76	Four patients who were rendered Doc_88336_108_116_Disease or Doc_88336_120_129_Disease by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described.
88336	2	193	Three patients received high doses of Doc_88336_231_246_Chemical for Doc_88336_251_258_Chemical Doc_88336_259_278_Disease, and one took a suicidal Doc_88336_304_312_Disease of Doc_88336_316_326_Chemical.
88336	3	328	The patient with Doc_88336_345_355_Chemical Doc_88336_356_364_Disease and two of those with Doc_88336_387_402_Chemical intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha Doc_88336_452_456_Disease', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG.
88336	4	544	The fourth patient who was unconscious after Doc_88336_589_604_Chemical administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range.
88336	5	687	All four recovered completely without Doc_88336_725_746_Disease following the withdrawal of the offending agents.
88336	6	797	The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological Doc_88336_876_886_Disease of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed.
88336	7	940	It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha Doc_88336_1064_1068_Disease.
88336	8	1070	It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication, in the absence of significant Doc_88336_1209_1219_Disease, a favourable outcome may be anticipated.
8864707	0	0	Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in Doc_8864707_50_59_Disease patients after Doc_8864707_75_84_Chemical Doc_8864707_85_96_Disease.
8864707	1	98	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Doc_8864707_161_170_Chemical medication and Doc_8864707_186_204_Disease in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication.
8864707	2	260	Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil.
8864707	3	389	Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation.
8864707	4	477	In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness.
8864707	5	588	The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum.
8864707	6	673	Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml).
8864707	7	765	In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes.
8864707	8	911	Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between Doc_8864707_979_986_Disease duration, elevation of Doc_8864707_1010_1019_Chemical serum levels and cerebellar volume.
8864707	9	1056	However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of Doc_8864707_1119_1128_Chemical treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters.
8864707	10	1205	We conclude that Doc_8864707_1222_1231_Chemical Doc_8864707_1232_1242_Disease does not necessarily result in Doc_8864707_1274_1292_Disease and it is unlikely that Doc_8864707_1317_1326_Chemical medication was the only cause of Doc_8864707_1360_1378_Disease in the remaining patients.
8864707	11	1406	Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of Doc_8864707_1509_1529_Disease.
891050	0	0	Late recovery of renal function in a woman with the Doc_891050_52_77_Disease.
891050	1	79	A case is reported of the Doc_891050_105_130_Disease (Doc_891050_132_135_Disease) in a woman taking Doc_891050_155_174_Chemical.
891050	2	176	She was treated with Doc_891050_197_204_Chemical, Doc_891050_206_218_Chemical and hemodialysis; and after more than three months, her urinary output rose above 500 ml; and six months after the onset of Doc_891050_343_349_Disease, dialysis treatment was stopped.
891050	3	383	This case emphasizes the possibility that Doc_891050_425_428_Disease in adults is not invariably irreversible and that, despite prolonged Doc_891050_498_506_Disease, recovery of renal function can be obtained.
891050	4	552	Therefore, in adult patients affected by Doc_891050_593_596_Disease, dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely; moreover, bilateral nephrectomy, for treatment of severe Doc_891050_704_716_Disease and Doc_891050_721_754_Disease, should be performed with caution.

8919272	2	198	Long-term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug Doc_8919272_259_275_Chemical (Vupral "Polfa") at the effective dose of 200 mg/kg b. w. once daily to rats for 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months revealed Doc_8919272_391_413_Disease indicating Doc_8919272_425_442_Disease ("Doc_8919272_445_454_Chemical Doc_8919272_455_469_Disease").
8919272	3	473	The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment.
8919272	4	638	They became more severe in the later months of the experiment, and were most severe after 12 months, located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex.
8919272	5	803	Lesions of the capillary included Doc_8919272_837_845_Disease of endothelial cells.
8919272	6	868	Organelles of these cells, in particular the mitochondria (increased number and size, distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae) and Golgi apparatus were altered.
8919272	7	1039	Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had Doc_8919272_1136_1143_Chemical protrusions and swollen microvilli.
8919272	8	1180	Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes.
8919272	9	1268	Fragments of Doc_8919272_1281_1289_Disease endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions.
8919272	10	1411	Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed.
8919272	11	1469	Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells, mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes.
8919272	12	1595	The proliferation of astrocytes (Bergmann's in particular) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found.
8919272	13	1702	Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells are earliest).
8919272	14	1842	In electron micrographs both Doc_8919272_1871_1878_Chemical and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions.
8919272	15	1958	The possible influence of the Doc_8919272_1988_2002_Disease, mainly Doc_8919272_2011_2025_Disease, upon the development of Doc_8919272_2051_2060_Chemical Doc_8919272_2061_2075_Disease is discussed.

8953972	1	76	We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of Doc_8953972_171_188_Disease in a case of Doc_8953972_202_217_Disease with Doc_8953972_223_231_Disease.
8953972	2	233	The sudden onset of Doc_8953972_253_273_Disease, Doc_8953972_275_279_Disease, and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous Doc_8953972_376_387_Chemical.
8953972	3	389	Subsequently, acute Doc_8953972_409_423_Disease and fatal Doc_8953972_434_457_Disease occurred.
8953972	4	468	Doc_8953972_468_479_Chemical has a proven role in Doc_8953972_501_515_Disease in prehospital care; however, use by paramedics in patients with suspected Doc_8953972_591_608_Disease and severe Doc_8953972_620_632_Disease should be viewed with caution.
8955532	0	0	Role of activation of Doc_8955532_22_32_Chemical B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute Doc_8955532_100_112_Disease.
8955532	1	114	Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute Doc_8955532_200_212_Disease are not clear.
8955532	2	228	The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of Doc_8955532_301_311_Chemical to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute Doc_8955532_391_403_Disease.
8955532	3	405	Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled Doc_8955532_497_504_Chemical before and during Doc_8955532_523_536_Chemical-induced acute Doc_8955532_551_563_Disease in rats treated with vehicle and Doc_8955532_597_604_Chemical (0.1 microM).
8955532	4	619	Doc_8955532_619_632_Chemical infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent Doc_8955532_720_727_Chemical by a similar magnitude in both groups.
8955532	5	767	These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute Doc_8955532_846_858_Disease is not related to the synthesis/release of Doc_8955532_902_912_Chemical to activate B2 receptors.
8996652	0	0	Risk factors of Doc_8996652_16_42_Disease in preterm infants.
8996652	1	63	Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991, 8 children (1.46%) developed severe progressive and bilateral Doc_8996652_208_234_Disease.
8996652	2	236	Perinatal risk factors of infants with Doc_8996652_275_287_Disease were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications.
8996652	3	407	Our observations demonstrated an association of Doc_8996652_455_467_Disease with a higher incidence of perinatal complications.
8996652	4	520	Doc_8996652_520_531_Disease appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of Doc_8996652_612_620_Disease drugs, particularly Doc_8996652_641_656_Chemical and Doc_8996652_661_671_Chemical.
8996652	5	673	Finally, we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as Doc_8996652_793_805_Disease is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe.

9034419	2	100	CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with Doc_9034419_139_155_Disease took an Doc_9034419_164_172_Disease of Doc_9034419_176_187_Chemical in an apparent suicide attempt.
9034419	3	220	After the ingestion of 26 Doc_9034419_246_257_Chemical 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized Doc_9034419_321_328_Disease.
9034419	4	330	She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, Doc_9034419_383_394_Chemical was discontinued, and no further sequelae were seen.
9034419	5	448	To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Doc_9034419_513_524_Chemical Doc_9034419_525_533_Disease that resulted in a generalized Doc_9034419_565_572_Disease.
9034419	6	574	Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Doc_9034419_636_647_Chemical and the potential risks of available interventions, no emergent therapy was instituted.
9034419	7	736	The Doc_9034419_753_764_Chemical Doc_9034419_765_773_Disease in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized Doc_9034419_833_840_Disease but elicited no further sequelae.

9088814	2	276	The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A (n = 10) were subjected to controlled Doc_9088814_392_403_Disease alone, those in group B (n = 10) to Doc_9088814_440_453_Disease alone and those in group C (n = 10) to both controlled Doc_9088814_509_520_Disease and Doc_9088814_525_538_Disease.
9088814	3	540	Doc_9088814_540_553_Disease in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of Doc_9088814_672_679_Chemical solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%.
9088814	4	735	Controlled Doc_9088814_746_757_Disease in groups A and C was induced with Doc_9088814_793_797_Chemical to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min.
9088814	5	863	Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, Doc_9088814_919_932_Chemical/Doc_9088814_933_950_Chemical) and clinical hepatic function parameters.
9088814	6	994	AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B.
9088814	7	1100	In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of Doc_9088814_1206_1217_Disease and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total Doc_9088814_1301_1310_Chemical showed significant increases after operation.
9088814	8	1357	The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of Doc_9088814_1430_1434_Chemical-induced Doc_9088814_1443_1454_Disease and moderate Doc_9088814_1468_1481_Disease would cause Doc_9088814_1494_1524_Disease.

9100294	2	269	The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that Doc_9100294_335_342_Chemical channel blockers in general induce Doc_9100294_378_406_Disease indicating a pharmacologic class effect.
9100294	3	448	We studied three Doc_9100294_465_472_Chemical channel blockers of different structure, Doc_9100294_514_524_Chemical, Doc_9100294_526_535_Chemical, and Doc_9100294_541_550_Chemical, along with the new agent.
9100294	4	578	Pregnant rats were administered one of these Doc_9100294_623_630_Chemical channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for Doc_9100294_745_773_Disease.
9100294	5	775	A low incidence of Doc_9100294_794_822_Disease was observed after exposure to each of the four Doc_9100294_871_878_Chemical channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for Doc_9100294_955_964_Chemical and Doc_9100294_969_979_Chemical.

9284778	9	1279	The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular Doc_9284778_1335_1343_Disease which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging Doc_9284778_1481_1489_Disease).
9284778	10	1492	Doc_9284778_1492_1507_Chemical-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes.
9284778	11	1566	Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with Doc_9284778_1633_1652_Disease, were detected in the serum of five affected workers.
9284778	12	1707	Repeated exposure of human beings to Doc_9284778_1760_1777_Chemical can result in serious Doc_9284778_1800_1812_Disease in a large proportion of the exposed population.
9284778	13	1862	Although the exact mechanism of Doc_9284778_1894_1908_Disease of these agents is not known, the results suggest that Doc_9284778_1964_1979_Chemical-altered liver proteins are involved.

9334596	1	111	We reviewed the results of serum Doc_9334596_153_165_Chemical and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of Doc_9334596_232_252_Disease and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities.
9334596	2	512	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doc_9334596_535_547_Chemical and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay.
9334596	3	599	Every patient was screened for Doc_9334596_630_642_Chemical and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of Doc_9334596_695_712_Disease, Doc_9334596_714_726_Disease or Doc_9334596_730_742_Chemical less than 4 ng./ml.
9334596	4	763	Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results.
9334596	5	825	Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with Doc_9334596_921_941_Disease and systematic prolactin determination.
9334596	6	982	Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were Doc_9334596_1063_1080_Disease, small testes and Doc_9334596_1099_1111_Disease.

9334596	8	1258	Doc_9334596_1267_1279_Chemical was less than 3 ng./ml. in 107 patients but normal in 40% at repeat determination.
9334596	9	1363	The prevalence of repeatedly low Doc_9334596_1396_1408_Chemical increased with age (4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older).

9334596	11	1550	Most of the other low Doc_9334596_1572_1584_Chemical levels seemed to result from nonorganic Doc_9334596_1625_1649_Disease because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in Doc_9334596_1741_1761_Disease (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).
9334596	12	1925	Determining Doc_9334596_1937_1949_Chemical only in cases of Doc_9334596_1967_1984_Disease or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low Doc_9334596_2062_2074_Chemical, including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy.
9334596	13	2142	Prolactin exceeded 20 ng./ml. in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination.
9334596	14	2226	Only 1 Doc_9334596_2233_2245_Disease was discovered.
9334596	15	2262	These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades (overall prolactin greater than 20 ng./ml. in 1.86% of 1,821 patients, Doc_9334596_2400_2413_Disease in 7, 0.38%).

9351491	1	105	Doc_9351491_105_116_Chemical is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at Doc_9351491_164_172_Chemical D2 and Doc_9351491_180_195_Chemical receptors.
9351491	2	207	Previous clinical studies have proposed that Doc_9351491_252_263_Chemical's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative Doc_9351491_331_349_Disease and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics.
9351491	3	462	To determine if routine Doc_9351491_486_497_Chemical treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of Doc_9351491_703_714_Chemical (n = 12) or Doc_9351491_727_738_Chemical (n = 7).
9351491	4	748	Both Doc_9351491_753_764_Chemical and Doc_9351491_769_780_Chemical produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses.
9351491	5	871	There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with Doc_9351491_946_957_Chemical or Doc_9351491_961_972_Chemical.
9351491	6	974	Doc_9351491_974_999_Disease was observed in subjects treated with Doc_9351491_1038_1049_Chemical (42%) and Doc_9351491_1060_1071_Chemical (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%.
9351491	7	1126	Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with Doc_9351491_1205_1216_Chemical at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.

9522143	1	89	The cause of Doc_9522143_102_114_Disease after spinal anaesthesia is unknown.
9522143	2	152	Up until now, the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post-operative Doc_9522143_265_291_Disease.
9522143	3	293	The aim of this study was to describe this Doc_9522143_336_348_Disease and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of Doc_9522143_408_420_Disease.
9522143	4	422	Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied: one group received 6 mL Doc_9522143_494_504_Chemical 2%; and the other received 3 mL Doc_9522143_537_548_Chemical 0.5%.
9522143	5	555	Patients given Doc_9522143_570_580_Chemical were more likely to develop Doc_9522143_609_621_Disease (10 out of 22) than those given Doc_9522143_654_665_Chemical (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05).
9522143	6	692	The average Doc_9522143_704_716_Disease for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after Doc_9522143_762_772_Chemical and 15 dB after Doc_9522143_789_800_Chemical.

9522152	1	129	We describe a case of transient Doc_9522152_161_181_Disease that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric Doc_9522152_259_270_Chemical slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle.
9522152	2	334	The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (Doc_9522152_512_538_Disease) without reduction in muscular strength.
9522152	3	580	Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks.
9522152	4	650	Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect.
9522152	5	811	However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient Doc_9522152_1135_1155_Disease.

9523805	1	126	Recent evidence suggests that Doc_9523805_168_197_Disease (Doc_9523805_199_203_Disease) frequently follow Doc_9523805_223_232_Chemical spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with Doc_9523805_275_286_Chemical.
9523805	2	288	However, identification of a short-acting local anesthetic to substitute for Doc_9523805_365_374_Chemical for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal.
9523805	3	432	Doc_9523805_432_442_Chemical is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of Doc_9523805_517_526_Chemical.
9523805	4	528	Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares Doc_9523805_594_604_Chemical with Doc_9523805_610_619_Chemical and Doc_9523805_624_635_Chemical with respect to duration of action and relative risk of Doc_9523805_692_696_Disease.
9523805	5	698	Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2% Doc_9523805_920_929_Chemical in 7.5% Doc_9523805_938_945_Chemical, 2% Doc_9523805_950_960_Chemical in 7.5% Doc_9523805_969_976_Chemical, or 0.5% Doc_9523805_986_997_Chemical in 7.5% Doc_9523805_1006_1013_Chemical.

9653867	1	65	Doc_9653867_65_81_Disease and the associated behavioural problems and Doc_9653867_126_136_Disease are uncommon in pregnancy.
9653867	2	164	When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus.
9653867	3	300	This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with Doc_9653867_381_397_Disease in pregnancy, including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse.
9653867	4	489	In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with Doc_9653867_583_599_Disease and reminds us that when a cause for Doc_9653867_637_651_Disease remains obscure, Doc_9653867_669_678_Chemical abuse should be considered and explored.
9660111	0	0	Repeated Doc_9660111_9_21_Chemical induces Doc_9660111_30_38_Chemical D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation.
9660111	1	82	Doc_9660111_82_94_Chemical (Doc_9660111_96_99_Chemical), which shows a clinical Doc_9660111_125_139_Chemical activity, is chemically related to Doc_9660111_175_185_Chemical but does not inhibit the reuptake of Doc_9660111_223_236_Chemical and Doc_9660111_241_260_Chemical, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation.
9660111	2	314	The mechanism of its Doc_9660111_335_349_Chemical activity is still unknown.
9660111	3	377	The aim of the present study was to find out whether Doc_9660111_430_433_Chemical given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various Doc_9660111_580_595_Chemical.
9660111	4	597	Doc_9660111_597_600_Chemical was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days.
9660111	5	693	In the acute experiment Doc_9660111_717_720_Chemical (given i.p.) does not antagonize the Doc_9660111_758_767_Chemical Doc_9660111_768_779_Disease in mice and does not potentiate the Doc_9660111_816_835_Chemical head twitches in rats.
9660111	6	859	Doc_9660111_859_862_Chemical given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor Doc_9660111_912_925_Disease induced by Doc_9660111_937_950_Chemical, Doc_9660111_952_962_Chemical and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (Doc_9660111_1005_1013_Chemical D2 and D3 effects).

9660111	8	1119	It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by Doc_9660111_1168_1181_Chemical (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the Doc_9660111_1266_1280_Disease evoked by Doc_9660111_1291_1300_Chemical in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor.
9660111	9	1378	It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic Doc_9660111_1425_1440_Chemical studied previously, Doc_9660111_1461_1464_Chemical given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain Doc_9660111_1520_1528_Chemical D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists.
9660111	10	1637	A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated Doc_9660111_1752_1767_Chemical, suggested to be responsible for the Doc_9660111_1805_1819_Chemical activity.

9766615	2	107	Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance.
9766615	3	170	Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health.
9766615	4	354	The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics.
9766615	5	477	Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including Doc_9766615_568_591_Disease (Doc_9766615_593_596_Disease), Doc_9766615_599_617_Disease, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, Doc_9766615_709_732_Disease, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, Doc_9766615_781_799_Disease, and Doc_9766615_805_816_Disease.
9766615	6	818	The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of Doc_9766615_865_868_Disease, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, Doc_9766615_972_983_Disease, Doc_9766615_985_1003_Disease, hepatic effects, lowered Doc_9766615_1030_1037_Disease threshold (primarily Doc_9766615_1059_1068_Chemical), and Doc_9766615_1075_1090_Disease (Doc_9766615_1092_1101_Chemical only).
9766615	7	1109	Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.
9812111	0	0	A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of Doc_9812111_58_69_Chemical for Doc_9812111_74_83_Disease and Doc_9812111_88_108_Disease in Doc_9812111_112_131_Disease.
9812111	1	133	The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of Doc_9812111_228_239_Chemical and placebo in the treatment of Doc_9812111_272_281_Disease and Doc_9812111_286_306_Disease in patients with Doc_9812111_324_343_Disease.
9812111	2	345	In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), Doc_9812111_434_445_Chemical, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and Doc_9812111_479_490_Chemical, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Doc_9812111_558_577_Disease.
9812111	3	579	For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose Doc_9812111_683_694_Chemical were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose Doc_9812111_797_808_Chemical.
9812111	4	810	For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose Doc_9812111_876_887_Chemical was efficacious and superior to both low-dose Doc_9812111_934_945_Chemical and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Doc_9812111_1007_1016_Disease factor and on Doc_9812111_1031_1052_Disease.
9812111	5	1054	Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%).
9812111	6	1202	The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B.
9812111	7	1274	In phase A, Doc_9812111_1286_1306_Disease tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs.
9812111	8	1463	Low-dose Doc_9812111_1472_1483_Chemical did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects.
9812111	9	1556	The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for Doc_9812111_1627_1638_Chemical in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe Doc_9812111_1712_1732_Disease.
9812111	10	1734	A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended.
9812111	11	1814	The narrow therapeutic window observed with Doc_9812111_1858_1869_Chemical may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Doc_9812111_1915_1934_Disease patients with Doc_9812111_1949_1958_Disease and Doc_9812111_1963_1983_Disease.
983936	0	0	Effects of Doc_983936_11_31_Chemical, Doc_983936_33_45_Chemical, and Doc_983936_51_65_Chemical on Doc_983936_69_80_Chemical-induced Doc_983936_89_106_Disease in dogs.
983936	1	116	A reproducible model for producing diffuse Doc_983936_159_176_Disease (Doc_983936_178_189_Chemical infusion) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute Doc_983936_321_342_Disease.
983936	2	344	Infusions of Doc_983936_357_368_Chemical (4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours) increased Doc_983936_423_435_Chemical uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline-infused control animals (4,957 vs. 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction).
983936	3	694	Myocardial concentrations of Doc_983936_723_730_Chemical also increased significantly (12.0 vs. 5.0 mg.per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight).
983936	4	814	Infusions of Doc_983936_827_843_Chemical sufficient to raise serum Doc_983936_870_877_Chemical concentrations 2 mEq. per liter failed to increase Doc_983936_929_936_Chemical influx into the myocardial cell.
983936	5	970	Mitochondrial Doc_983936_984_996_Chemical uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with Doc_983936_1061_1081_Chemical or Doc_983936_1085_1097_Chemical or when Doc_983936_1106_1120_Chemical was added to the Doc_983936_1138_1149_Chemical infusion (2,682,2,803, and 3,424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction, respectively).
983936	6	1244	Myocardial Doc_983936_1255_1262_Chemical concentrations also were decreased (11.2, 8.3, and 8.9 mg. per 100 Gm. of fat-free dry weight, respectively) in the three treatment groups, being significantly decreased only in the last two.
983936	7	1455	Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups.
983936	8	1543	Doc_983936_1543_1563_Chemical, Doc_983936_1565_1577_Chemical, and Doc_983936_1583_1597_Chemical all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model.
9855119	0	0	Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with Doc_9855119_74_84_Chemical (Doc_9855119_86_91_Chemical) for at least one year.
9855119	1	116	We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with Doc_9855119_235_245_Chemical (Doc_9855119_247_252_Chemical) for more than 1 year.
9855119	2	276	Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated.
9855119	3	433	Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy).
9855119	4	663	The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent Doc_9855119_804_819_Disease (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic Doc_9855119_873_878_Chemical Doc_9855119_879_890_Disease (n = 9), and mild-type Doc_9855119_914_919_Chemical Doc_9855119_920_931_Disease (n = 11).
9855119	5	942	Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic Doc_9855119_1029_1034_Chemical Doc_9855119_1035_1046_Disease, respectively.
9855119	6	1062	Chronic Doc_9855119_1070_1075_Chemical Doc_9855119_1076_1087_Disease consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), Doc_9855119_1225_1259_Disease (4 biopsies) and the striped form of Doc_9855119_1297_1318_Disease (11 biopsies).
9855119	7	1334	The serum Doc_9855119_1344_1354_Chemical levels of patients in the mild-type chronic Doc_9855119_1399_1404_Chemical Doc_9855119_1405_1416_Disease group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic Doc_9855119_1524_1529_Chemical-Doc_9855119_1530_1541_Disease group (P< 0.001).
9855119	8	1560	This study demonstrates that chronic Doc_9855119_1610_1615_Chemical Doc_9855119_1616_1627_Disease consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic Doc_9855119_1762_1767_Chemical Doc_9855119_1768_1779_Disease is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.
9862868	0	0	Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of Doc_9862868_87_128_Disease.
9862868	1	130	Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation.
9862868	2	281	Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in Doc_9862868_321_332_Disease, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information.
9862868	3	470	Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized.
9862868	4	569	Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability.
9862868	5	656	We used rat models of Doc_9862868_678_702_Disease by Doc_9862868_706_723_Chemical (Doc_9862868_725_727_Chemical) treatment and Doc_9862868_743_767_Disease by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage.
9862868	6	842	Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope.
9862868	7	972	In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion.
9862868	8	1085	In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL.
9862868	9	1191	Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL.
9862868	10	1350	After Doc_9862868_1356_1358_Chemical treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule.
9862868	11	1531	This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and Doc_9862868_1682_1684_Chemical treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.
9869257	0	0	Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the Doc_9869257_87_100_Chemical releaser Doc_9869257_110_114_Chemical.
9869257	1	116	The effects of Doc_9869257_131_135_Chemical (Doc_9869257_137_178_Chemical), the Doc_9869257_185_198_Chemical releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated.
9869257	2	285	In the mouse passive-avoidance test, Doc_9869257_322_326_Chemical (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented Doc_9869257_407_414_Disease induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug Doc_9869257_469_480_Chemical and the M1-selective antagonist Doc_9869257_513_525_Chemical.
9869257	3	527	In the same experimental conditions, Doc_9869257_564_568_Chemical (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced Doc_9869257_648_655_Disease, demonstrating a central localization of the activity.
9869257	4	711	At the highest effective doses, Doc_9869257_743_747_Chemical did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test.
9869257	5	923	Doc_9869257_923_927_Chemical was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
9869257	6	1032	The maximal NGF contents obtained by Doc_9869257_1069_1073_Chemical were 17.6-fold of the control value.
9869257	7	1111	During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of Doc_9869257_1194_1198_Chemical.
9869257	8	1200	The current work indicates the ability of Doc_9869257_1242_1246_Chemical to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells.
9869257	9	1360	Therefore, Doc_9869257_1371_1375_Chemical could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.
9931093	0	0	Mechanisms of Doc_9931093_14_20_Chemical-induced Doc_9931093_29_41_Disease in the rat. -Doc_9931093_55_65_Chemical (Doc_9931093_67_73_Chemical) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant.
9931093	1	121	The clinical utility of Doc_9931093_145_151_Chemical is complicated by substantial Doc_9931093_182_194_Disease and Doc_9931093_199_213_Disease.
9931093	2	215	To clarify the mechanisms of Doc_9931093_244_250_Chemical-induced Doc_9931093_259_271_Disease, we studied the chronic effects of Doc_9931093_307_313_Chemical on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial Doc_9931093_446_458_Chemical synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels.
9931093	3	579	In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist Doc_9931093_657_666_Chemical on Doc_9931093_670_676_Chemical-induced Doc_9931093_685_697_Disease in rats was studied.
9931093	4	719	Doc_9931093_719_725_Chemical, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively).
9931093	5	938	Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA.
9931093	6	1011	Doc_9931093_1011_1017_Chemical decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively).
9931093	7	1112	The administration of Doc_9931093_1134_1143_Chemical (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented Doc_9931093_1173_1179_Chemical-induced Doc_9931093_1188_1200_Disease in rats.
9931093	8	1210	These results indicate that Doc_9931093_1238_1244_Chemical may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing Doc_9931093_1335_1337_Chemical synthesis in the vasculature.
