<s> A method for the measurement of Doc_689020_32_38_Disease, and a comparison of the effects of tocolytic beta-mimetics. </s>
<s> A method permitting measurement of finger Doc_689020_142_148_Disease as a displacement-time curve is described, using a test system with simple amplitude calibration. </s>
<s> The coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape. </s>
<s> By means of a computer program, periods and amplitudes of Doc_689020_445_451_Disease oscillations were calculated and classified. </s>
<s> The event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined. </s>
<s> The actions of Doc_689020_589_611_Chemical, Doc_689020_613_625_Chemical and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method. </s>
<s> At therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean Doc_689020_806_812_Disease amplitude to about three times the control level. </s>
<s> At the same time, the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10--20 ms, whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly. </s>
<s> After the end of Doc_689020_1067_1089_Chemical infusion, Doc_689020_1100_1106_Disease amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following Doc_689020_1170_1182_Chemical infusion. </s>
